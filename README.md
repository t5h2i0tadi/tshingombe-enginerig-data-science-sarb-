EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Commercial miscellaneous electric loads (C-MELs) are generally defined as all non-main commercial building electric loads. That is, all electric loads except those related to main systems for heating, ventilation, cooling, water heating, and lighting. Miscellaneous electric loads account for an increasingly large portion of commercial electricity consumption.1 Generally, the number of types of loads and the number of loads has increased. Furthermore, as commercial building main-loads and building envelopes (insulation, fenestration, etc) become more efficient, C-MELs tend to account for a larger percentage of the overall building energy. To support its strategic planning efforts, DOE/BT contracted TIAX to characterize the current state of commercial MELs. This includes analysis of their unit energy consumption and annual electricity consumption (for 2008) based on building type, as well as an initial assessment of the energy-saving potential for MELs based on current best-available technology and practices. Beyond its general interest in C-MEL annual electricity consumption (AEC), DOE’s Building Technology Program (DOE/BT) has a goal to support the construction of costeffective net zero-energy buildings (NZEB). Because MELs can account for the greatest portion of energy consumption in efficient commercial buildings, reducing C-MEL energy consumption is an important part of achieving net zero energy commercial buildings. Consequently, it is important for DOE/BT to understand the current C-MEL energy consumption by building type and to incorporate this information into modeling and research efforts to optimize NZEB designs. On the other hand, reducing C-MEL energy consumption can be more challenging than reducing the energy consumed by other end uses. Countless different products fall under the broad title of C-MELs, which complicates and increases the cost of implementing measures to reduce C-MEL energy consumption. In addition, office equipment accounts for a significant portion of C-MEL energy, and these devices have, historically, evolved rapidly and had much shorter useful lives than other end uses. Fortunately, we believe that the majority of C-MEL energy can be modeled by assessing a smaller set of key loads. Furthermore, many C-MELs differ from “conventional” building loads in that they can vary greatly between building types. For example, office equipment accounts for a significant portion of office building energy consumption, medical equipment makes a significant contribution to healthcare facilities, and vending machines have a significant impact on lodging. For this reason, this analysis breaks down the C-MEL energy consumption for nine commercial building types. In coordination with the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Building Technologies office, TIAX selected six to ten “key” loads for each of nine commercial building types. The se- 1 EIA, Annual Energy Outlook 2009, Mar 2009, Table A5, pp.119-120. http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/aeo09/pdf/0383(2009).pdf 1-9 lection process included a preliminary energy consumption estimate of a set of possible key loads. Key loads were selected based on their estimated energy consumption for each building type. Generally, the preliminary estimates showed C-MELs consume at least 1 TWh/year in building types in which they are considered key loads, although this was not used as a strict cut-off point. The preliminary energy consumption estimates for evaluating key versus non-key loads were based on an initial data collection pass from relevant literature sources for each load. In total, TIAX selected 28 key commercial MELs for further investigation, as shown below: Refrigeration Other Building MELs Non-Building MELs 1. Unit Coolers 11. Slot Machines 21. Water Supply & Purification 2. Central 12. ATMs 22. Waste Water Treatment 3. Residential Type 13. Vending Machines 23. Distribution Transformers 4. Ice Machines 14. Vertical Transport 24. Mobile Phone Towers 5. Warehouse 15. Non-Road Vehicles Medical 6. Walk-in 16. Landscape Irrigation 25. Medical Imaging Consumer Electronics 17. Fitness Equipment 26. Other Medical Equip. 7. PCs 18. Laundry 27. Cooking 8. Monitors 19. Fume Hoods 28. Data Center Servers 9. Other Office Equipment 20. Arcade Machines 10. Televisions The key building MELs are those from the list of 28 that are used inside buildings. The ‘other key MELs’ include loads such as mobile phone towers or waste water treatment, which are not specifically associated with a building type, but are considered commercial MELs in this analysis. The nine building types considered include: office, retail & service (non-food), food service, food sales, education, warehouse, healthcare, lodging, and public assembly, order, and religion (AOR). These building types are consistent with the main types defined in the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS),2 which was most recently published for 2003 by the DOE Energy Information Administration. This consistency allows for straightforward comparisons with other data sources. The CBECS definitions included three individual categories, public assembly, public order, and religious, but given their lower energy consumption, TIAX combined them to form the public AOR category. In total, commercial buildings consume about 20% of the total U.S. primary energy (18.3 quadrillion btus (quads) per year).3 Of the commercial, residential, and industrial sectors, the per-building and per-square foot energy use intensity, is greatest in commercial buildings. Unlike the residential sector with approximately 115 million households (BEDB, 2009), the commercial sector’s energy consumption is concentrated in 5 million buildings 2 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), Completed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Data available at http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/. Building definitions are discussed at http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/building_types.html 3 EERE, 2009, “2009 Building Energy Data Book,” U.S. DOE. Estimate interpolated from 2006 and 2010 data, Table 1.1.3 1-10 (EIA, 2006), indicating that some energy savings measures may be more cost and time effective to implement. The evaluated key C-MELs consume a total of 504 TWh of electric energy in commercial buildings per year, or 5.5 quads of primary energy. This is 30% of the 18.3 quads consumed by the commercial energy sector, as shown in below in Figure 1. 3.3 quads are associated with key building MELs while an additional 2.2 quads were consumed by other key loads not associated with specific building types (a.k.a., other key MELs).

Gas Loads &Balance, 2.6 Commercial, 18.3 Quads of Primary Energy Consumption 2008 Total = 101.5 quads* Figure 1: TIAX addressed 5.5 quads of C-MELs identified as both "Key Building MELs" and "Other Key MELs"4 The “miscellaneous gas loads” shown in Figure 1 include things such as gas heated laundry dryers and gas cooking. There is also a remaining “balance” after adding main loads, MELs, and miscellaneous gas loads, which may come from unaccounted for miscellaneous loads, uncertainty in the energy consumption in any category, or may be a statistical artifact resulting from summing of values from different sources. Given that 92 TWh of site electric energy is approximately equivalent to 1 quad of primary energy, and that a 1 gigawatt power plant delivers approximately 8 TWh/yr of electricity, TIAX’s key MELs consume the output of more than 11 one gigawatt power plants. They account for approximately 30% of the commercial primary energy and 5.5% of the U.S. primary energy. In aggregate, the evaluated C-MELs consume more electric energy than any of the traditional building main loads, as shown below in Figure 2. 4 EERE, 2009, “2009 Building Energy Data Book,” U.S. DOE.

MELS account for 26% and 28% of office building energy and education building energy, respectively, largely because of PCs, monitors, and other office equipment. The total energy consumption for each key C-MEL across all building types is plotted in Figure 4.

Each bar represents the energy consumption in the commercial sector for the stated key MEL. Key C-MELs were evaluated in building types in which they represented a significant load. Bars in Figure 4 that are only blue indication that for any building type in which the load was not key, it was a negligible load. The bars that also include red sections (“estimated total for non-key building types”), are an indication that a portion of the load’s energy consumption is in building types in which it is not considered a key load, but, in aggregate, is noteworthy. The pie chart in Figure 4 groups the key C-MELs into appropriate categories. Office electronics consume nearly 25% of the total. Refrigeration Equipment, water supply and treatment equipment (namely, pumps), and distribution transformers (both inside and outside of buildings) each used over 80 TWh in 2008, or 16% each. 1-13 In order to identify energy savings opportunities, TIAX selected or estimated “best-inclass (BIC)” models from each of the 28 selected load types. For the most part, the energy consumption associated with BIC units was derived directly from energy efficient units that are currently on the market. By comparing the BIC to the typical unit used in the baseline calculations, TIAX generated a technical “energy savings potential (ESP)” for each load. Assumptions about the market penetration and impact of emerging technologies are not addressed in this study, and therefore the ESP is not necessarily fully achievable due to many market factors, but also may be more than 100% achievable in cases where new technologies are on the horizon. It is assumed that all current units are replaced by the BIC unit. The “by load”, and “by load category” energy savings potential estimates, which include estimates for both key and non-key building types, are shown below in Figure 5. Secondary impacts on building cooling and heating loads are not addressed in this study, but, generally, reducing a building’s MEL energy consumption will result in an equal reduction in cooling loads during the cooling season. On the other hand, reducing MELs will increase the buildings heating load during the heating season, although it is generally the case that the building’s heating system is more efficient than the resistance heating provided by MELs.

The loads with highest savings potential include PCs, monitors, walk-in refrigeration, office equipment, and distribution transform- 7 Source: 2009 Buildings Energy Data Book, DOE/EERE. 2008 values interpolated from 2006 data points and 2010 projected data points – See Tables 3.14, 3.15, and 3.17. 1-14 ers. Each of these loads has the technical potential for a reduction of approximately 15 TWh/yr or greater. Electronics (namely, PCs, monitors, and other office equipment) account for about 50% (88 TWh/yr) of the estimated energy savings potential. This energy savings potential is mainly driven by the potential impact of power management. Other key drivers for this energy savings are the transition from desktops to laptops (or at least to equivalent components and power saving design strategies in a desktop form factor), and the transition from CRT monitors to efficient LCD monitors. Highlights and Conclusions: ¾ Key C-MELs in standard building types consume 300 TWh/yr ¾ Key C-MELs in non-standard building types and key non-building C-MELs consume 200 TWh/yr, or 40% of the key C-MEL total ¾ Consumer electronics make up 25%, refrigeration makes up 15%, and cooking equipment makes up 10% of the key C-MEL total ¾ Water supply and treatment combined consumes 15% and distribution transformers outside and inside buildings consume 15% of the key C-MEL total ¾ According to CBECS data, nearly 50% of building C-MEL energy is consumed in large buildings (>50,000 ft2 ), which account for 5% of commercial buildings and 50% of the commercial floor area ¾ Data center servers, i.e., servers located in purpose-built data center buildings, account for 6% of key C-MEL energy, excluding cooling energy, and are growing rapidly ¾ There is a C-MEL energy savings potential of 176 TWh (2 quads) by replacing the installed devices with currently available energy efficient devices Recommendations: The insights gained from this characterization of commercial MELs point to several recommendations for further study. Each one is discussed separately in the following subsections. Regular Evaluation of Rapidly Evolving MELs: A significant portion of the devices evaluated have – and, in many cases, continue to – undergone dramatic changes in their installed base, their usage, and their functionalities, characteristics, and underlying technologies (and, hence, their power draw by mode). This is particularly true of electronics (namely, office electronics and data servers), which have changed dramatically over the last couple of decades and tend to have much shorter average product lifetimes (i.e., on the order of a few years compared to 10 or more for white goods), but also true of some other products as well (e.g., the increased installed base of mobile phone antennas). In all cases, it has significant ramifications for DOE’s goal of net zero-energy buildings (NZEB) in the future. Consequently, we recommend performing regular (e.g., every 3-4 years) evaluations of MEL energy consumption and energy savings potential to understand how the evolution 1-15 of MELs are affecting the feasibility of cost-effectively attaining DOE’s building efficiency goals. Furthermore, we recommend that brief annual updates (executive summary style) be performed in order to keep installed base and UEC estimates current and statistically representative of the installed stock. More Refined Evaluation and Characterization of MEL Energy-Saving Opportunities: Our initial characterization of energy-saving opportunities for commercial MELs primarily focuses on energy savings attainable using existing products. Although we found that this approach can yield overall reductions in MEL energy of about 35%, it probably is not realistic to rely on a large portion of the five million commercial buildings to purchase such “best-in-class” devices to realize large-scale savings. Furthermore, it is often very challenging to reduce the building energy consumption of many MELs via other pathways (e.g., automated controls) due to the low annual energy cost savings potential for most MELs and building owners’/operators’ disdain for measures that might adversely affect device utility or usability or impact business operations. We recommend that DOE perform a study focused on a thorough characterization of commercial MEL energy savings opportunities with an emphasis on a critical assessment of the likelihood that a large portion of real buildings would accept and effectively deploy different measures. Ultimately, this could be used to develop a roadmap for credibly achieving major (e.g., 35%) reductions in MELs that identifies the technologies and policies needed to reach realize those reductions. The initial focus should be on large (>50,000 square feet) buildings, which consume 50% of the key MEL energy, but are only 5% (~250,000) buildings. These buildings may also see appreciable reductions in operating costs from energy savings measures, and therefore may be more amenable to adopting such measures. Data Gathering by Building Type to Fill Key Data Gaps: TIAX found a lack of current data, particularly by building type, for many C-MELs to develop accurate bottom-up estimates. We recommend that the DOE conduct power measurements by mode for a sample representative of the installed base for key C-MELs in key building types. Likewise, interviews, surveys, or actual measurements are needed to more accurately understand the usage patterns of key MELs in key building types. Obtaining real operating data can be time and budget intensive, and therefore a focused work plan is needed to fill the largest data gaps with the largest impact on energy consumption. We recommend starting with large commercial buildings (i.e., greater than 50,000 square feet). 2-16 2 INTRODUCTION We define miscellaneous electric loads, hereafter referred to as MELs, as electricityconsuming loads that do not fall under the conventional end use categories of lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and water heating. Key types of MELs in commercial buildings, i.e., C-MELs, include consumer electronics, refrigeration, cooking, laundry, elevators, ATMs, and more. Unlike in residences, where loads are quite similar between buildings, in the commercial sector, each set of key MELs can vary dramatically among buildings of different types. For example, office buildings exhibit high energy consumption from consumer electronics (CE) including PCs and monitors, while food sales buildings, such as supermarkets, have significantly fewer consumer electronics, and significantly more energy consumption associated refrigeration systems. To add yet another dimension of complexity, the usage patterns across building types varies for many loads. While, for example, a residential type refrigerator generally has the same load no matter where it is located, cooking equipment loads vary significantly by building type. A restaurant may have a high concentration and usage of broilers and ranges for preparing customer meals, while a supermarket may have a high concentration and usage of ovens for baked goods. As electricity consumption continues to grow in the United States, MELs are anticipated to increase at a disproportionately high rate. According to the 2009 Buildings Energy Data Book from the EERE/DOE, the total primary energy consumption in the commercial sector will increase by 36% to 25 quads by 2030, while the portion that constitutes CMELs is projected to grow 78% during that period. By comparison, main loads are anticipated to grow minimally: lighting and space heating, 3%, space cooling, 1%, and ventilation, -14% (a decrease). The projected MEL growth is broken down by category in Figure 6 below. 2-17 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Electronics (Exc.

PCs and other office equipment have penetrated all businesses, and all building types, creating a much larger installed base of CEs. The prices have dropped significantly allowing even the average users to purchase more units. Additionally, the number of distinct MELs within the category has grown, driven by the increased use and penetration of information and communication technologies (ICT). Historically, the energy consumption of all miscellaneous loads has been addressed in aggregate. However, due to their relatively rapid growth over the past several decades, miscellaneous loads are now generally broken down into key groups, such as refrigeration, cooking, PCs, and office equipment. As is shown in Figure 6, there still remains a large “other” category, with a large projected growth. While more challenging, the evaluation of the current state of a larger set of key MELs provides a more accurate understanding of how buildings consume energy and helps guide energy efficiency research and prioritize the implementation of efficiency programs. During this study, TIAX characterized the key miscellaneous loads in each of the nine key building categories. Furthermore, by comparing the typical installed unit of each MEL to the best-in-class, we established a technical savings potential that gives an indication of potential impact of implementing energy efficiency programs. We do not, however, attempt to incorporate user acceptance levels, market penetration, or other market issues into the savings potential estimates. As a result, further work is recommended to establish a realistic, achievable energy savings for the various MELs. 8 Source: 2009 Buildings Energy Data Book, DOE/EERE. 2008 values interpolated from 2006 data points and 2010 projected data points – See Tables 3.14, 3.15, and 3.17. 2-18 2.1 Study Approach To support its strategic planning efforts, DOE/BT contracted TIAX to characterize commercial MELs (C-MELs), analyze their unit and annual electricity consumption (for the 2008 calendar year), and carry out an initial assessment of the energy-saving potential for C-MELs using best-available devices and practices. This study: • Provides estimates of U.S. commercial MEL electricity consumption by commercial building type • Provides estimates of non-traditional commercial MELs found outside (i.e., before the electric meter) of buildings (e.g., water supply, distribution transformers) •Establishes preliminary technical energy-saving potential estimates of C-MELs using currently available, energy efficient devices and technologies •Guides energy efficiency research and activities by aggregating the results and comparing them with main load, sector, and national energy consumption totals. To realize these goals, TIAX and DOE/BT decided upon the following approach to the project: 1. Develop an extensive list of C-MELs for potential evaluation 2. Select six to ten key C-MELs for evaluation in each of nine building types as well as for ‘other buildings and non-building’ C-MELs 3. Characterize the key C-MELs by building type 4. Analyze the unit and national (U.S.) electricity consumption, and installed base of key C-MELs 5. Assess the energy savings potential for key C-MELs from existing products and technologies – a ‘technical energy savings potential’ 6. Present findings to DOE/BT and other relevant parties 7. Compose a final report to DOE/BT presenting the main findings and clearly explaining the methodology This report describes the methodology, results, findings, and recommendations of the commercial miscellaneous electric load study. 2.2 Report Organization This report has the following organization: Section 3: Summary of the methodology used to assess the electricity consumed by C-MELs Section 4: Description of the key commercial building types by which the key C-MELs were categorized Section 5 Assessment of the energy consumption of the 28 key C-MELs and the estimate of technical energy savings potential. 2-19 Section 6 Presentation of the energy consumption of selected key C-MELs in each key building type Section 7 Conclusions of this report and recommendations for further study 3-20 3 METHODOLOGY 3.1 Preliminary Assessment TIAX’s evaluation of C-MELS began with a brainstorm of potential loads, utilizing knowledge from our prior residential MELs study as a foundation, and adding in additional loads that are unique to commercial buildings. Potential loads were selected based on their estimated impact on commercial building energy consumption. After an initial judgment based down-selection process (i.e., removing loads that are relatively uncommon or commonly understood to consume relatively little energy), the collective group of addressed C-MELs included: Arcade Games Non-Road Vehicles ATM Office Equipment Cell Phone Tower Other Medical Equipment Central Refrigeration PC Coffee Maker Pool Pump/Heater Cooking Equipment Residential Refrigeration Distribution Transformers Slot Machine Elevator Set Top Box (STB) Escalator TVs Fitness Equipment Unit Cooler Fume Hood Vacuum Gas Pump Vending Machine Ice Machine Walk-in Refrigeration Lab Equipment Warehouse Refrigeration Landscape Irrigation Water Cooler Medical Imaging Equipment Water Pumping Microwave Water Purification Monitor Wastewater Treatment Some of the listed loads are actually load categories (e.g., office equipment, cooking equipment) in which like devices are grouped. It serves to aggregate the load from a set of like devices when without such aggregation, some of these loads would not be considered as key loads, and may have been excluded from the study. However, given the similarities between devices, and their comparatively large energy consumption by category, it seems prudent to judge their impact in aggregate. Furthermore, energy efficiency strategies will often apply to all of the devices in the group. Examples of such C-MEL groups are as follows: Office: Servers, fax machines, printers, multi-function devices, etc. Medical Imaging: X-Ray, CT, MRI Medical Other: Ophthalmoscope, EKG, ultrasound, etc. Lab: Oscilloscope, power supply, Multi-meter, furnaces, centrifuges, etc. Cooking: Broiler, fryer, range, oven, steamer, griddle Fitness: Elliptical trainer, stair climber, treadmill, etc. 3-21 It is important to note that some of these miscellaneous loads are split between gas powered and electric powered. This evaluation did not address the loads, or portions of loads that consumed gas energy. For example, cooking in commercial buildings has a significant gas component, but TIAX only evaluated the electric cooking equipment. Other loads, like laundry, may use both simultaneously. The gas portion of the load in these cases (e.g., dryer heating) was disregarded, and only the electric motor energy consumption and electric heating were counted in the evaluation. In order to establish which loads were to be fully assessed in this evaluation (i.e., key CMELs), the team categorized each load by approximate annual electricity consumption (AEC) for each commercial building type. Preliminary AEC estimates were collected or calculated from relevant literature sources. Each load was ‘bucketized’ into one of five categories based on the preliminary estimate for AEC: < 0.5 TWh/yr, ~0.5, > 1, >5, >10, >20, >40. Using this system, TIAX selected six to ten key C-MELs for each building type. Generally, the preliminary estimates showed C-MELs consume at least 1 TWh/year in building types in which they are considered key loads. Although this was not used as a strict cutoff point, loads that were initially found to be well above 1 TWh or well below 1 TWh were not analyzed in further detail during the down-selection process. More detail was put into loads that were estimated to be approximately 1 TWh. Final cut-off decisions were made in collaboration with DOE based on a special interest or potential energy savings opportunities for a load. These preliminary evaluations served as starting points for deeper analysis of each “key” load. The key C-MELs that were selected based on the preliminary estimates are shown below in Table 1 for each building type.

Data centers (containing servers) and laboratories (containing fume hoods) are buildings, but are classified in the ‘other’ category by CBECS. The non-building loads are found outside of buildings, but were of interest because of their potentially large energy consumption. Collectively, TIAX assessed 28 different loads across 7 categories, including: 3-23 Refrigeration ¾Unit Coolers ¾Central Refrigeration ¾Residential Type Refrigeration ¾Ice Machines ¾Warehouse Refrigeration ¾Walk-in Refrigeration Consumer Electronics ¾PCs ¾Monitors ¾Other Office Equipment ¾TV Medical ¾Medical Imaging ¾Other Medical Equipment Cooking Data Servers Other Building C-MELs ¾Slot Machines ¾ATMs ¾Vending Machines ¾Vertical Transport (Elevators & Escalators) ¾Non-road Vehicles ¾Landscape Irrigation ¾Fitness Equipment ¾Laundry ¾Fume Hoods ¾Arcade Machines Non-building C-MELs ¾Water Supply and Purification ¾Waste Water Treatment ¾Distribution Transformers ¾Mobil Phone Towers 3.2 Full Load Evaluation TIAX’s assessment of the 28 different loads was approached as a bottom-up study. That is, as opposed to beginning from total energy consumption in the United States and breaking down that number step by step until each category had been filled, the team collected various pieces of data and built up the estimates from the basic components. The amount of information available varied from load to load and generally increased with greater AEC. The biggest loads are generally under greater scrutiny and are better understood on a national level. Ideally, TIAX compiled the fundamental AEC components together to get the energy consumption for a given load: the total stock or installed base, and the power and annual usage for each relevant operating mode (e.g., active, idle, sleep, off). The method of finding the AEC using this information is laid out below in Figure 7. 3-24 Note: Modes Illustrative, actual modes will vary by device M UEC AEC Stock Device Annual Electricity Consumption Tactive Pactive Tsleep Psleep Toff Poff Active Sleep Off Mode Annual Usage, by Mode Power, by Mode x x x = X Device Annual Unit Electricity Consumption, by Mode = S = UECactive = UECsleep = UECoff Device Unit Electricity Consumption Tidle Pidle Idle x = UECidle Figure 7: TIAX utilized the most detailed information available regarding usage, power, and installed base to calculate the total AEC for each load. For PCs, for example, there is a large amount of information available which allows for calculations of each piece of data as described above. In other instances, UEC data was available, but not a breakdown of power and usage by operating mode. In the event that older data was used, adjustments were made to account for the various device trends. In most cases, not all required pieces of the information are available, and TIAX must make assumptions based on the best available information and our general knowledge of the loads and load trends to estimate the average UEC of the load. Measurements and the collection of new data were outside the scope of this report. Rather this report is intended to serve as a broad overview of C-MELs energy consumption by building type, identify data gaps and uncertainties, and guide further focused research. Load categories introduce further complications to the process since they may include a significant number of types of equipment. Ideally, the UECs of numerous units are averaged based on a weighting of installed base to get a representative UEC for the category. This adds another dimension of uncertainty to the UEC estimates. Often, the information available for the different devices in a category is of varied levels of detail. TIAX used the best available information to guide the assumptions made in this analysis. The methodology and key assumptions for each load are described in Section 5. 4-25 4 BUILDING TYPES For the purposes of the TIAX C-MELs study, commercial buildings have been broken down into ten categories (nine specific building types plus other buildings). They generally follow the principal building activity (PBA) categories as defined by the DOE/EIA Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). The categories, as modified from CBECS, are described below. It is important to note that inherent in the CBECS “principle building activity” definition is the fact that buildings are characterized by the activity that takes up the largest amount of floor space. In an extreme case, this can mean that a building has loads associated with all of the nine building types as a result of containing numerous different businesses. 4.1 Office Buildings Office buildings are those that are used for general office space, professional offices, or administrative offices. Medical offices are included here if they do not use any type of diagnostic medical equipment (if they do, they are categorized as healthcare buildings). Examples include: Administrative/professional office contractor's office Government office non-profit or social services mixed-use office research and development bank or other financial institution city hall or city center medical office religious office sales office call center OFFICE Total Admin or Profess. Bank or financial Gov’t Medic Mixed Use Other Qty Bldgs (000) 824 442 104 84 37 84 73 Avg ft2 /bldg(000) 15 15 11 18 6 28 6 ’03 Elec use (TWh) 210.6 112.5 22.5 27.3 3.0 38.4 7.0 4.2 Non-Food Retail and Service Buildings Retail buildings are those that are used for the sale and display of goods other than food. This includes shopping malls, which are comprised of multiple connected establishments, either in an enclosed or in a strip-mall configuration. Service buildings are those in which some type of service is provided, other than food service or retail sales of goods. 4-26 Examples include: retail store dry cleaner or Laundromat beer, wine, or liquor store post office or postal center rental center car wash Vehicle/boat Dealership gas station studio/gallery photo processing shop enclosed mall beauty parlor or barber shop strip shopping center tanning salon vehicle service or repair shop copy center or printing shop vehicle storage/ maintenance kennel repair shop RETAIL Total Vehicle Sales Retail Store Other Retail Qty Bldgs (000) 443 50 347 47 Avg ft2 /bldg (000) 10 12 10 5 ’03 Elec use (TWh) 61.8 8.0 48.7 5.1 SERVICE Total Post Office Repair Shop Vehicle Service Vehicle Maint.

By definition, malls contain a number of different building types and/or sub-types, and therefore it is extremely difficult to pinpoint specific key loads. The electric load of these buildings is quite high, however, and this data cannot be overlooked. Due to the distributed nature of the load, very little detailed information is available for mall buildings. For areas of this study where specific data is not available, TIAX calculates loads based on the assumption that mall buildings consist of 10% food service and 90% non-food retail and service. 4-27 4.3 Food Sales Buildings Food sales buildings are those that are used for retail or wholesale of food. Examples include: grocery store or food market gas station convenience store convenience store FOOD SALES Total Convenience Convenience w/gas Grocery store / market Other Qty Bldgs (000) 226 57 72 86 10 Avg ft2 /bldg (000) 6 3 4 8 10 ’03 Elec use (TWh) 61.1 9.5 13.9 36.0 1.7 4.4 Food Service Buildings Food service buildings are those that are used for preparation and sale of food and beverages for consumption.

A dormitory on a college campus is not considered an education building due to its location; it is a ‘lodging’ building. Examples include: elementary or middle school adult education high school career or vocational training college or university religious education preschool or daycare EDUCATION Total College Element.

Examples include: hospital clinic inpatient / outpatient rehabilitation veterinarian medical office HEALTHCARE Total Diagnostic Office Clinic Hospital Qty Bldgs (000) 128 54 66 8 Avg ft2 /bldg (000) 25 9 11 241 ’03 Elec use (TWh) 72.6 5.8 14.5 52.3 4.8 Public Assembly, Public Order, Religious Worship (Public AOR) Buildings Public assembly buildings are those in which people gather for religious, social, or recreational activities, whether in private or non-private meeting halls. Religious buildings include chapels, churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples. Public order buildings are those that are used for the preservation of law and order or public safety. Under CBECS, this category was broken out into three small categories. For the purpose of this TIAX study, the categories will be combined as one. Public assembly buildings include: social or meeting exhibition hall recreation broadcasting studio entertainment or culture transportation terminal library police station funeral home fire station student activities center jail, reformatory, or penitentiary armory courthouse or probation office 4-29 PUBLIC AO&R Total Fire Police Entertain Library Rec.

Examples include: airplane hangar agricultural with some retail space crematorium data center or server farm laboratory telephone switching manufacturing or industrial with some retail space CBECS recorded 191,000 other types of buildings in the United States in 2003 that did not fit into other categories listed above. In total, these buildings consumed 30 TWh/yr of electricity. These building classifications are based on the principal activity that takes place in the building and does not account for smaller sub-activities in a portion of a building. Therefore, a 10 story office building that has retail shops on the first floor will still be considered an office building. In addition, it must be noted that the location of a building does not necessarily influence its PBA. For example, an administration office building on a university campus is an ‘office’ building, not ‘education,’ despite being part of an aca- 4-30 demic institution. In a similar fashion, dormitories are classified as ‘lodging,’ not ‘education.’ 4.11 Building Data TIAX collected summary information on the above building types from CBECS to give a better picture of how the building types compare in terms of numbers and square footage. The total square footage among building types is compared below in Figure 8, and the total number of buildings by building type are shown below in Figure 9. 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 Food Sales Food Service Health Care Lodging Public AO & R Education Warehouse Office Retail Service: Non‐food Total Square Footage (Millions) Figure 8: Building floor area broken down by building type.

PC-based power management such as standby mode Data Uncertainties The number of arcade machines per establishment 5.1.1 General Discussion Arcades are coin or token-operated, electronic entertainment machines installed with various types of video games. They are predominantly found in gaming centers and theme parks and to a lesser extent in bowling centers and cinemas. Other than the aforementioned establishments, it is assumed that the number of arcades in other building types is relatively small. Their hardware components are similar to that of high-end PCs including sophisticated graphics and sound cards. In addition, a lot of the more advanced arcade games have specialized user input/control accessories, for example steering wheels, motor cycle handles, joysticks, light guns, sport bats and dancing mats as well as other specialized components that add to the user experience such as vibrations actuators or other forms of force feedback controls. The computationally-intensive nature of video games to generate and display elaborate graphics is the primary reason why arcades consume an appreciable amount of energy. 5.1.2 Energy Savings Discussion Ensuring arcades are powered off during non-operating hours is a simple method to reducing energy consumption. Using a timer plug is one solution to facilitate and automate the shutdown of arcade gaming machines, which can save up to 1860 kWh per machine (NUS, 2009). In addition, due to arcade machines having similar hardware components as that of PCs, various levels of power management such as a “standby mode” could be utilized. Using this method the machine draws less power depending on computational load. 5-33 5.1.3 References BMI Gamings, 2009, "Arcades Directory | Where to Play Arcade Games in the USA ," October, Available online at: http://www.bmigaming.com/arcadelocations.htm CAPCOM, 2009 "1st Quarter Report Fiscal year ending March 31, 2009," Quarter report, March.

They rapidly grew in popularity as a convenient access point for customers and as an additional way to generate revenue for building owners. Growth increased at a dramatic rate to a peak of 400,000 installed units in 2005 (Kerber, 2008). At that time, two market forces combined to cause a decline in the number of unit to what it is today: saturation of the market, increased use of credit and debit cards for purchases. Installed base growth trends are shown in Figure 12. 5-34 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Number of ATMS in the US (000s) Figure 12: ATM installed base growth grew rapidly until saturation and increasing use of debit and credit cards caused a decline in 2005 (Kerber, 2008). ATMs can either be stand-alone units or through-the-wall units (Roth, 2002). While applications vary between manufacturers, through-wall units are generally full service financial units, while stand-alone units are generally for cash dispensing only. The throughwall type is what would be found in a bank branch, while stand alone units are more commonly found in retail areas of buildings. While TIAX assumes that ATM energy consumption is only key in food sales and retail and service buildings, ATMs are found in a wide variety of locations. They are placed in any space that may facilitate consumer spending, including some bars (food service), hotel bars or lobbies (lodging), stadiums, theatres, bowling allies, or other recreational buildings (public assembly), and retail areas in offices. 5.2.2 Energy Savings Discussion Based on approximate savings potential of individual ATM components, TIAX estimates that each unit has an 80% energy savings potential. This assumes a 20% savings during active use (based on best-in-class active mode energy consumption), as well as a 90% savings in stand-by, or idle mode. The extreme savings during non-active use is based on PC and LCD display energy savings during sleep mode (~95%). Given that ATMs require always-active security measures, such as cameras, and potentially occupancy sensors, TIAX adjusted the potential savings accordingly. This 80% savings corresponds to a UEC of 610 kWh/yr. 5.2.3 References ADL, 1993, “Characterization of Commercial building Appliances” June, 1993 by Arthur D. Little for DOE.

The cooking equipment being considered includes the following: • Broilers (free-standing, Salamanders, charbroilers, convey broilers) • Fryers • Griddles • Ovens (convection, deck ovens, range ovens) • Ranges • Steamers High AEC values for cooking equipments are primarily attributed to their high power consumption and usage patterns. A lot of equipment in the commercial sector, particularly in the food service & fast food industry, experience heavy standby energy loss due to the need to leave equipment on between use periods to expedite the cooking of food and/or to keep food warm. The breakdown of how each type of cooking equipment contributes to the total AEC is shown in Figure 2. Ovens are by far the largest load, due to their high installed base compared to other cooking equipment. Broiler, 6% Fryer, 13% Griddle, 13% Oven, 42% Ranges, 4% Steamer, 22% Broiler Fryer Griddle Oven Ranges Steamer Figure 13: Ovens contribute over 40% of the electric load of cooking equipment. An ADL (1992) report solicited industry expert feedback and used survey data to estimate the number of cooking equipment inventory by building type as well as their typical sizes and respective hours of operation. In addition, their estimate of typical rated capacities was obtained from catalogs of manufacturers such as Garland Commercial Industries, Vulcan Corporation, Cleveland Range, Frymaster, Beverage Air and Middleby Marshall. Capitalizing on the information from the ADL (1992), TIAX used the number of establishments by building type obtained from CBECS (EIA, 2006) to estimate cooking equipment installed base and AEC for each building type. As mentioned, electrical cooking equipment has a smaller installed based than gas-fired equipment. However, there are currently no Energy Star ratings for cooking equipment 5-37 and no mandated minimum efficiency standards, or even industry-wide uniform testing procedures. ADL (1993) proposed a “first principles” analysis for calculating cooking efficiency defined as the theoretical amount of energy required to cook the food consisting of sensible, latent and endothermic heats of reaction divided by the total energy input to the system: ηcooking = Cooking efficiency Where: ηcooking = in food Q Q Qfood = Heat required by the food Qin = Total input energy Where: M food = Mass of Food (lb) ∆Hcooking = Theoretical amount of energy require to cook the food (200- 700 Btw/lb depending on application) ηSS = Steady state cooking efficiency (50%–60% on average for most cooking equipment) QSB = Standby energy loss rate SB t = Standby time It is important to note that the actual operating efficiency will always be less than the steady state cooking efficiency due to the fact that cooking equipment is sized for the peak usage; idle (stand-by) and part load usage generates significant energy losses. From the above equation, cooking efficiency can be theoretically increased by: • Increasing the steady state cooking efficiency • Reducing the standby energy losses SB SB SS food cooking in Q t M H Q + ∆ = η ( )( ) 5-38 5.3.2 Energy Savings Discussion Summarized in the table below, currently available technologies can potentially save energy across all cooking equipment. In addition to the technologies mentioned, there are others which can augment existing technologies at saving energy in cooking equipment. Examples include: • Reduced diameter • Energy management system • Oil-less cooking • Inductive cooking • Microwave assist Some of the technologies mentioned are applicable to certain types of equipment due to the nature of their operation and the industry in which they are predominantly installed. For example double sided griddles in the fast food industry can reduce energy consumption by increasing product throughput during hours of operating. Commercial service steamers may have achieved some efficiency gains by implementing efficient residential steam boiler designs developed in response to the DOE minimum efficiency standards program, although it is unclear the level at which this technology transfer has occurred.

This voltage transformation can occur in multiple stages, depending on application, but all electrical energy used in the US passes through at least one distribution transformer before being used in end-use equipment. There are two basic types of distribution transformers, and they are defined by their insulation: liquid-immersed or dry-type. However, they can be further categorized in the following ways: Number of phases - single or three phase; voltage class (for dry-type) - low or medium; basic impulse - insulation level (BIL) for medium-voltage, dry-type. Liquid-immersed transformers rely on oil or other liquid circulating around the coils for cooling. Dry-type transformers on the other hand only use natural convection of air for insulation and cooling. Liquid-immersed transformers are generally more efficient than dry-type due to more effective heat transfer in liquid cooled systems. Generally speaking, distribution transformers are reliable and efficient devices, with no moving parts and average life spans of more than 30 years. There are, however, various factors that affect the overall efficiency of distribution transformers. There is a continuous core loss as a result of being constantly energized and ready to serve a needed load. In addition, there is winding loss associated with temperature and the average load on transformers, which is expressed in terms of percentage of transformer capacity. The figures below, taken from Cadmus Group (1999) study, depict the wattage loss and as result transformer efficiency with respect to load for a 75 kVA transformer model. 5-40 Figure 14: Total Losses versus Load for Three Representative 75kVA Transformer Models (Cadmus Group, 1999) Figure 15: Efficiency versus load for three representative 75kVA models (Cadmus Group, 1999) It is also important to note from the Cadmus Group (1999) study that the average transformer loads varied little across building types with an RMS average load of 15.9%. The surveyed buildings were universities, healthcare facilities, manufacturing facilities, office buildings, and retail facilities. Each building had an average floor area of roughly 100,000 square feet since most transformers in the commercial sector are in large buildings. The consistent average load across building types implies that there is generally a consistent transformer efficiency value. Typically, distribution transformer efficiencies are in the range of 97% to 99.5% (LBNL’s Energy Efficiency Standards, 2009). For this study, TIAX calculated energy loss associated with distribution transformers in the various building types using an efficiency value of 98.5% applied to electrical energy going into build- 5-41 ings of over 50,000 square feet for each building type. This energy loss comes from inefficiencies in distribution transformers that are on the customer side of the electric meter. TIAX estimates an additional aggregate energy loss of 73 TWh from transformers that are owned by utilities and thus are not associated with any building type. This value was derived by scaling from the transformer energy consumption 1996 to 2008, based on the growth in overall electric energy consumption during that period, or approximately 20%. ORNL (1996) estimated the annual energy lost in the delivery of electricity from distribution transformers used by utilities was approximately 61 TWh in 1996. Around 90% of all liquid-immersed transformers are owned by electric utilities while the remaining systems are owned by commercial and industrial customers (ORNL, 1996). Conversely, more than 90% of the total dry-type market is non-utility (i.e., commercial and industrial sector). (ORNL, 1996) 5.4.2 Energy Savings Discussions Because all electric energy passes through one or more distribution transformers, energy savings associated could prove to be significant even if there is a slight incremental improvement in the efficiency. Dry-type transformers are less efficient than liquid-immersed and are primarily purchased on the basis of first cost and local availability rather than efficiency. As a result, they pose an appreciable untapped opportunity for efficiency improvements. Application of energy-efficient equipment can reduce transformer losses by about 20%, substantially cutting a facility’s total electricity bill and offering a typical payback of less than three years (deLaski et al., 1998). The 20% reduction in energy loss is also consistent with the study from ORNL (1996). To address these losses and encourage the purchase of more efficient transformers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) developed and published the voluntary industry standard TP-1-1996, Guide to Determining Energy Efficiency for Distribution Transformers (NEMA, 1996, deLaski et. al. 1998). The standard addresses both dry and liquid-filled transformers. Furthermore, it covers low-voltage general purpose drytype specialty transformers. In addition to TP-1, NEMA has developed and issued TP-2, a test method for transformer efficiency, and is in the process of developing TP-3, a labeling standard to identify transformers that meet TP-1 (Hinge et al., 2000). Lastly, working with NEMA, the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE), and others, the EPA launched the ENERGY STAR commercial and industrial (C&I) transformers labeling program, which is also based on the TP-1 standard for low-voltage dry-type transformers, making it simpler to identify efficient transformers in the market place (Hinge et al., 2000). 5.4.3 References Cadmus Group, 1999, “Metered Load Factors for Low-Voltage, Dry-Type Transformers in Commercial, Industrial, and Public Buildings,” Report for Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships and Boston Edison Company, December.

Data Uncertainties Installed base of fitness equipment in building types other than public assembly, ratio of treadmills and other fitness equipments, average UEC. 5.5.1 General Discussion Fitness equipment is predominantly found in gyms and fitness centers. It is important to note that for this study, buildings that house gyms and fitness centers are considered public assembly buildings, even if those buildings are a part of academic institutions. Fitness equipment comes in a variety of types and models. The devices that consume the largest amount of energy are primarily those used for stationary cardiovascular exercises such as treadmills, elliptical trainers, stationary bicycles, stair-steppers and rowing machines. Out of the various types of fitness equipment, treadmills draw the most power as a result of their internal electric motors that are used to drive moving conveyor belt platforms. Users can control the speed of the belt as well as the inclination of the platform to increase the intensity of the workout. Energy consumption from other electrical components common to treadmills and other fitness equipment are considered relatively negligi- 5-43 ble. These include small computer consoles and sometime monitors to calculate, control and display workout duration, levels, heart rates, calories burnt and other exercise parameters. Unlike treadmills, the majority of other aforementioned fitness equipment relies on the user’s motion to generate electricity. As a result, the electrical energy consumption is generally much less than treadmills due to the absence of motors. Exercise intensity is adjusted using various forms of both electrical and mechanical resistance mechanisms such as magnets, electromagnets and fans. Electrical consumption is primarily attributed to these resistance mechanisms. The average power draw for elliptical machines is about 200 Watts (Smooth Fitness, 2009), which is a quarter of that of treadmills (Woodway 2009). 5.5.2 Energy Savings Discussion For fitness equipment other than treadmills, relying more on mechanical mechanisms to create resistance as well as servicing equipment are good ways to reduce energy consumption. For treadmills, Woodway has come up with a patented technology for a near frictionless drive system which allows treadmill running surfaces to glide on smooth rolling ball bearings. This allows for a much smaller drive motor that Woodway claims to consume 50% less electricity. According to Woodway (2009), friction is the biggest detriment to conventional treadmills. Each time a user takes a step they literally push down the nylon belt onto the deck, requiring the motor to work much harder to overcome friction. This results in a power surge and increased power draw. Woodway’s frictionless drive system technology essentially eliminates these power surges as depicted by the figure below from Woodway (2009). 5-44 Figure 16: Average Power Consumption comparison between Woodway and Conventional Treadmills.

They work by drawing fresh air from the front opening and expelling the contaminated air from inside the hoods via ducts to the exterior of the building. In specialized systems, the air is recycled via a filtration system. Due to their large power draw and predominantly 24-hour usage, fume hoods are one of the biggest energy consumers of any laboratory equipment. Other laboratory equipment such as those that have electric heating elements including ovens, furnaces, incubators, refractory, autoclaves also consume a significant amount of energy, but have been left out of this study due to insufficient data and very minimal energy savings potential. To be consistent with the MEL-centric nature of this study, TIAX addressed only the energy consumption of the air-handling components of fume hoods, i.e. the energy used to drive ventilation fans. The energy used for conditioning of replacement air in fume hoods is not considered. There is an appreciable amount of uncertainty in how fume hoods are distributed between building types. They are concentrated in laboratory environments, but this includes both dedicated laboratory buildings and buildings which contain lab space but primarily functions as offices or education buildings. There are many examples of buildings that primarily serve as offices or class room buildings but contain laboratories. The best estimates indicate there is a 50% split in distribution of fume hoods in laboratory buildings versus being in a laboratory that is a minority part of another, non-key building type (mainly offices and education buildings). 5-46 5.6.2 Energy Savings Discussion Fume hoods pose a significant opportunity for energy savings among laboratory equipment. According to LBNL (2003) report, an estimated 50% energy reduction can be achieved for each fume hood through a variety of methods, including: • Use of a combination of dampers, variable speed ventilation, and digital controls to vary air volume while maintaining constant face velocity • Restriction of the hood’s face opening area while maintaining a constant airflow • Introduction of tempered outdoor air near the face of the hood (space conditioning savings) • Use of Berkeley Lab’s hood design concept of using a "push-pull" approach to contain fumes and exhaust them from the hood. Small supply fans located at the top and bottom of the hood’s “face,” gently push air in low velocity into the hood (see figure below) creating an "air divider" that separates the fume hood’s interior from the exterior. As a result, the need to expel large amount of air from the hood is reduced unlike conventional hoods which use higher velocity airflow.

Additionally, little information is available on current installed base. The base data point for this assessment is 1991 ADL. 5.7.1 General Discussion Ice is made through traditional vapor-compression refrigeration. A water pump provides steady flow of water over the evaporator plate where the ice accumulates. When sufficient ice has accumulated (generally sensed by thickness or weight), a condenser bypass valve diverts flow directly from the compressor to the evaporator, thereby heating up the plate surface enough to melt the ice and let it fall. In some systems, a mechanical mechanism assists the gravity harvesting system. 5-48 Cubed Ice Machine Energy Consumption by Cooling Mechanism 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Daily Ice Capacity (lbs) Energy Consumption (kwh/100 lb ice) Self-Contained (SCU) Ice Making Head (IMH) Remote Condensing Unit (RCU) Figure 17: SCUs are generally used for low capacity ice production (<250 lbs per day), whereas IMH and RCU are used for higher production installations. There are five general types of ice machines based on both configuration and cooling type. These include air and water cooled ice making heads (IMH) that are combined with various size storage bins, air-cooled remote condensing units (RCU), and water and air cooled self-contained units (SCU). The energy consumption (by configuration) of 200 AHRI certified units is shown in Figure 17. In general, SCUs are generally the smallest, with capacities ranging up to 450 lbs per day. Beyond that size, there is a fairly even mix of RCU and IMH units. In looking at the same data by cooling mechanism, one can see that water-cooled systems generally use slightly less energy, and that they are evenly spread across the size categories. ADL estimates that in 1996, 80% of ice machines had air-cooled integrated condensers (IMH or SCU). The graph in Figure 18 shows the energy consumption of AHRI certified units. 5-49 Cubed Ice Machine Energy Consumption by Cooling Mechanism 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Daily Ice Capacity (lbs) Energy Consumption (kwh/100 lb ice) Air Cooled Water Cooled Figure 18: Energy Consumption (per 100 lbs of ice) of AHRI certified ice makers The AHRI uses a testing environment that is 90 degree inlet air and 70 degree inlet water; depending on the location of use, this may turn out to be higher temperatures and corresponding energy consumption than may actually be exhibited. In general, and especially at lower capacities, the air-cooled units are more energy intensive. When it comes to actual usage costs however, water-cooled units have the potential to be much more expensive. All units are recommended to use 24 gallons or less for 100 lbs (12 gallons is the minimum feasible), but in addition, water cooled units are recommended to use 215 gallons of condenser cooling water per 100 lbs of ice. In total, that is more than 1075 gallons, or 1.4 ccf (hundreds of cubic feet) per day. Depending on specific commercial water and sewage rates for a given region or utility, this can become a majority of the usage costs. 5.7.2 Energy Savings Discussion A big, often overlooked benefit of water-cooled units and all RCU ice machines is that the heat from the ice making process is discharged outside, thereby preventing an increase in air-conditioning load. For air-cooled units, the heat is discharged inside at the expense of the air conditioner and the owner (EERE/DOE, 2009). The ADL study from 1996 on “Energy Savings Potential for Commercial Refrigeration Equipment” outlines six different measures that could be taken to improve energy efficiency. The total potential savings from these six measures is 1200 kWh/yr for a unit with a 500 lb/day capacity. These measures include (ADL 1996): • High-Efficiency compressor (280 kWh/yr potential reduction) – For a small price premium, ADL estimates that compressors could be used that are 5 to 10% more efficient 5-50 • ECM Condenser Fan Motor (271 kWh/yr potential reduction) – Replacing the 100W shaded pole motor that is most commonly used with an ECM motor would saving nearly 66% of the condenser fan energy. • Thicker Insulation ( 150 kWh/yr potential reduction) – Doubling the thickness of the insulation is estimated to save 3% on energy costs • Reduced melting during harvest (230 kWh/yr potential reduction) – Approximately 15% of the ice can melt during ice harvest. ADL estimates that by adding in a mechanical mechanism to assist the heating process, the melt during harvest could be cut by more than 50% for a reduction in cycle consumption of 5%. • Reduced evaporator thermal cycling (210 kWh/yr potential reduction) – approximately 9% of the compressor energy during the freeze cycle is due to evaporator cycling. ADL assumes that the thermal mass could be reduced by a factor of two, which would reduce the energy consumption by 4 to 5%. • High-efficiency fan blades (61 kWh/yr potential Reduction) – Optimized ice blades could provide 15% savings on fan energy consumption. If all of these measures are used, each unit has the potential to save 24% on annual energy consumption. For the purposes of Energy Saving Potential calculations, TIAX uses this mark as the ‘Best-In-Class’ model. 5.7.3 References ADL, 1996, “Energy Savings Potential for Commercial Refrigeration Equipment,” Arthur D.

Since this study is limited to commercial buildings, the focus is on irrigation pertaining to golf courses and landscaping since they are the two major contributors to water usage that lie within the commercial sector. For landscaping, there is little data on how much energy is directed towards commercial irrigation but TIAX assumes 25% i.e. substantially less than residential irrigation since nearly 50% of all water withdrawn for public supply is used solely to water residential lawns (FDEP, 2009). Golf course irrigation is estimated to use more than 476 billion gallons of water annually in the U.S. (Zoldoske, 2003). According to Staples (2009b), a typical golf course uses 250,0000 to 500,000 kWh per year and around 25% to 50% of the electricity consumed by golf courses is used to power pumping systems for water distribution throughout the course. Rarely are pumping systems’ efficiencies explicitly known and may often produce 10% to 20% less than they should due wear and tear over time (Staples, 2009b). 5.8.2 Energy Savings Discussion Many opportunities exist for saving energy in commercial irrigation. Some of easiest available savings come from the following methods: • Installing more efficient hardware such as National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium efficiency-rated motors for the pumping systems. • Optimizing water usage to reducing pumping. There are various methods described by MDE (2009) such as using only low-water use plant material in non-turf areas; automating irrigation systems monitored by moisture probes (i.e., tensiometers); design dual watering system with sprinklers for turf and low-volume irrigation for plants, trees, and shrubs; operate sprinkler system before sunrise and after sunset since the amount of irrigation can be determined by the evapotranspiration rate. • Taking advantage of novel technologies such as the following, which can lead of to 30% in energy savings (Sciencedaily, 2009), Environmental Leader, 2006): o Wireless sensors described by Sciencedaily (2009), which optimizes current irrigation systems by measuring and calculating the correct water requirements in real time using information gathered by small electronic devices distributed along the golf course forming a sensor network. These nodes allow for the sprinklers to be activated and deactivated efficiently. o Variable frequency drive, which enables a pumping system to adjust itself to demand, and new software for more precise system control, can significantly reduce both energy and water consumption (Environmental Leader, 2006). 5-52 5.8.3 References Environmental Leader, 2006, "Golf Course Upgrades Could Yield 30% Energy Savings," Web article, December, Available online at: http://www.environmentalleader.com/2006/12/21/golf-course-upgrades-couldyield-30-energy-savings/ EPA, 2009 "Golf Course Adjustment Factors for Modifying Estimated Drinking Water Concentrations and Estimated Environmental Concentrations Generated by Tier I (FIRST) and Tier II (PRZM/EXAMS) Models," Downloaded in October 2009 at: http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/models/water/golf_course_adjustment_factors.htm FDEP, 2009, “Florida Department of Enivionmental Protection: The Journey of Water”, article.

This study is only evaluating electric energy consumption, and the majority of commercial dryer are gas powered. Therefore, the majority of the energy consumed by commercial dryers is not considered here. Likewise, the majority of the energy consumed for commercial clothes washer is actually consumed by water heaters to heat the water used in the process. The energy considered in this study is the electric energy used by washer and dryer motors and controls. About 85% of commercial laundry equipment is found in non-food service buildings (e.g., coin and route operations). Laundry equipment is also considered to be a key MEL in lodging buildings (e.g., hotels, motels, nursing homes, and dormitories). CBECS data suggests that approximately 65% of lodging buildings (72% of lodging square footage) and 80% of nursing homes have on-site laundry equipment. (EIA, 2006). On the other hand, 80% of hospitals do not have on-site laundry, and therefore the energy is consumed in non-food service buildings. The average unit energy consumption is approximately 330 kWh/yr, but the average for specific commercial building types varies based on the assumed usage pattern. 5.9.2 Energy Savings Discussion Federal standards were initiated for residential-style commercial washer energy and water usage in 2007. The modified energy factor (MEF) sets the amount of energy that can be consumed for the sum of water heating energy, operation energy, and post wash drying energy per load capacity. Additionally, a water factor (WF) sets the maximum amount of water that can be consumed during a wash per load capacity. Tax incentives such as EPACT 2005 have also helped to promote the penetration of more efficient wash equipment. Generally, the electric energy consumption of laundry equipment is reduced by reducing wash agitator energy or by reducing dryer time. The Energy Star commercial washer energy calculator indicates that efficient commercial equipment (with a gas dryer) consumes about 25% less electric energy than conventional equipment. 5-54 5.9.3 References ADL, 1993, “Characterization of Commercial Building Appliances,” Prepared for the Building Equipment Division Office of Building Technologies, U.S. DOE, June.

As expected, this equipment is found almost exclusively in healthcare buildings. The data in Table 13 represents a weighted average of these three key medical imaging equipment types. Ultrasound imaging equipment is not included due to the lack of reliable data, and the anticipated lower energy consumption. In 2008, there were approximately 170 thousand medical X-ray machines in the U.S. and 16 thousand CT scanners. The installed base was estimated based on data from state health departments for California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania, the most populated states, which track the equipment that emit radiation. The installed base was scaled nationally based on population. The installed base of MRI equipment in 2008 was approximately 9 thousand (Bell 2004, Bell 2006). In general, the unit energy consumption of medical imaging equipment is increasing. Higher resolution equipment typically consumes more energy. Additionally, the installed base of medical equipment is increasing, adding to the growth in annual energy consumption of this C-MEL. 5-55 5.10.1.2 Energy Savings Discussion Energy efficiency has not generally been a key parameter for medical imaging equipment, although it seems that manufacturers are becoming more aware of the concerns with healthcare building energy consumption. One manufacturer now promotes a 1.5 T MRI system that consumes 40% less energy than conventional systems, claiming efficient gradient and electronics design and more efficient cooling technology. We have applied these savings to MRI equipment in our energy savings potential calculation, but it is unclear to what extent power management and other energy savings measure could reduce medical imaging equipment energy consumption. 5.10.2 Other Medical Equipment Table 14: Summary for other medical equipment for buildings in which it is a key load Healthcare Total Total AEC (Twh/yr) 3 3 Energy Intensity (kWh/1,000 sqft) 950 45 Energy Savings Potential (TWh/yr) unclear unclear Energy Savings Measures Power management, energy efficient design practices Data Uncertainties Estimate based on energy consumption per floor area in sample medical buildings (LBNL 2004), there is very high uncertainty in these estimates due to the large range of devices included and the lack of available data. 5.10.2.1 General Discussion In addition to large medical imaging equipment, there are other medical imaging technologies not accounted for above. Ultrasound, dental x-ray, mammography, and fluoroscopy equipment, for example, are not included. Furthermore, there is an abundance of other medical equipment that consumes energy. Heart rate monitors, otoophthalmoscopes, hospital beds, exam tables, exam lights, sterilizers, defibrillators, IV carts, etc. are all found in healthcare buildings. It does not appear that any one device consumes a significant amount of energy, but LBNL (2004) found that miscellaneous medical equipment consumed approximately 1,000 kWh per 1,000 square feet of floor area for a small sample of healthcare buildings. This scales to approximately 3 TWh per year for all healthcare buildings, assuming approximately 3 billion square feet for healthcare buildings. If the buildings sampled by LBNL (2004) are representative of healthcare buildings in the U.S., there may be an installed base of over 30 million miscellaneous medical devices. This installed base is not very meaningful given the large number of device types it could incorporate. Further investigation is needed to find the medical devices which consume the bulk of the energy in the sub-category. 5-56 There is a high degree of uncertainty in the estimates for ‘other’ medical equipment due to the large number of device types and the lack of available data. The estimates provided should be considered as preliminary. 5.10.3 References Bell, R., 2004, “Magnetic Resonance in Medicine in 2020”, Imaging Economics, December, 2004.

Mobile phone towers are generally not associated with building energy consumption, but may be considered a commercial miscellaneous electric load. We have assumed that towers installed on top of buildings have their own electric meters, and are therefore independent of the building energy consumption. Also, the term “tower” is used loosely, since antennas installed on buildings may not require an actual tower. Furthermore, a single site (e.g., tower or building roof) may have multiple antennas from multiple wireless carriers. The antennas and other communications equipment for each carrier, or tenant, generally have separate utilities installed, and therefore should be considered as separate units. However, we do not have data to support this level of granularity, and our installed base estimate is likely for individual sites, which may or may not have equipment from multiple carriers. There are an estimated 175,000 cell sites in the U.S., which consume approximately 4.4 TWh/yr. Towers are equipped with antennas, transmitters, and other electronics to support the mobile phone infrastructure. There is little public information regarding the power draw and usage of the current installed base. However, through discussions with an industry expert, we were able to define the UEC range to be 6,600 kWh/yr for low traffic towers to 43,000 kWh/yr for high traffic towers. Assuming a normal distribution of low and high traffic towers, the average UEC was calculated to be approximately 24,900 kWh/yr. Mobile phone towers will have a power draw profile that follows call traffic. We do not have information regarding the power profile, but have estimated the average power draw to be 2.8 kW, which assumes that installed towers are active all the time. There is a high degree of uncertainty in the estimates for mobile phone towers due to the lack of available data. The estimates provided should be considered as preliminary. 5.11.2 Energy Savings Discussion The energy savings potential for mobile phone towers is unclear. There are opportunities to install onsite wind or solar power generation to partially or completely offset the electric energy requirement from the grid. There are examples of both solar and wind powered mobile phone towers in industry for rural or secluded sites. Furthermore, there may be power management techniques that could reduce energy consumption during off-peak periods. However, it is not known what power management methods are already being implemented. We have not calculated an energy savings potential for mobile phone towers in this study. Further analysis is necessary to understand the applicability of different energy savings measures. 5.11.3 References Discussions with industry expert, July, 2009 Wired, 2005, “Cell-Phone Tower Debate Grows,” August, available at: http://www.wired.com/gadgets/wireless/news/2005/08/68600 5-58 5.12 Monitors Table 16: Overview of findings for Monitors in buildings for which it is a key load (details in Section 6) Office Retail & Services Food Sales Food Service Education Ware house Health care POA &R Lodging Other Total Total AEC (TWh/yr) 11 2.7 0.5 0.5 6.7 0.8 1.9 1.1 2 0.2 27 Energy Intensity (kWh /1000ft2 ) 900 180 400 300 680 79 600 130 390 46 380 Installed Base (1000s) 63,000 15,000 3,000 3,000 38,000 4,400 11,000 6,000 11,000 1,200 160,000 Units / 100,000ft2 520 98 240 180 390 44 350 68 220 28 220 Energy Savings Potential 66% savings per unit 18 TWh/yr Energy Savings Measures Greater penetration of LCDs (vs. CRTs), Higher efficiency LCD backlighting, Adoption of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays, Increasing PM-enable rates via factory installation, user, PC-automated PM Data Uncertainties PM-enabled rates, Usage patterns 5.12.1 General Discussion Monitors are electrical equipment that display images generated by PCs, mostly desktop PCs. Laptops, which have their own monitors, are sometime connected to docking stations which utilize external monitors. The installed base of monitors comprises of primarily three types of display technology which include: liquid crystal display (LCD), cathode ray tube (CRT), and plasma (PDP). Once dominated by CRT displays, the monitor market has transitioned to liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Plasma has not gained a substantial market share due to its relative high cost compared to the other two technologies. The popularity of LCD monitors is attributed to their compact size, minimal screen flicker and competitive price. It is also the most energy efficient, consuming significantly lower energy compared with CRTs. In this report, we have estimated monitor usage patterns in three key building types (offices, education and healthcare) based on the LBNL (2007) study where sixteen buildings in three cities were surveyed. According to LBNL (2007), 75% of the U.S. installed base of computers is found among the three aforementioned building types, which is where highest concentration of monitors will be located as well. 5.12.2 Energy Saving Discussion Similar to PCs, increasing the PM-enabled rates will have a substantial impact on monitor UEC and AEC. Table 5 lists the power draw by mode for best in class monitors according to data gathered by Energy Star (2005). 5-59 Table 17: Best in Class UEC from Energy Star Monitors Product List (EPA, 2005) Active [W] Sleep [W] Off [W] Brand and Model CRT – 17” 37 2 1 Lanix LN710S LCD – 15” 14 0.7 0.5 NEC AccuSync LCD52V Mitsubishi DiamondPoint V51LCD Philips 150B6 LCD – 17” 15 2 1 Lanix 700P Lanix AL170 LCD – 19” 23 0.9 0.7 AccuSync LCD92V Mitsubishi DiamondPoint V91LCD An appreciable reduction in energy consumption can be attained as more LCD replace older CRT monitors. The bulk of the energy savings comes from lower active mode power draw. Furthermore, energy savings could be achieved through the implementation of automatic brightness control (ABC), although the potential savings from ABC have not been determined in this study. Future technologies such as LCDs with high efficiency backlights and organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays could offer further significant reductions in unit electricity consumption. OLEDs have many advantages such as greater range of colors, brightness, contrast and viewing angle compared to LCDs. In addition, LCDs use a backlight and cannot show true black, while an off OLED element produces no light and consumes no power. Energy is also lost in LCDs because they require polarizers that filter out about half of the light emitted by the backlight. 5.12.3 References EIA, 2006, “2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS),” Public Use Microdata Files, Downloaded from: http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/cbecs2003/public_use_2003/cbecs_pudata200 3.html on August 2009.

There are approximately 575 thousand electric lift trucks in the U.S., the majority of which are assumed to be found in warehouses. There are approximately 975 thousand electric golf carts in the U.S., and golf courses are considered to be public assembly buildings. Electric burnishers are assumed to be generally evenly distributed among large buildings, and do not make a significant energy contribution to any one building type. Forklifts are divided into classes. Class 1 and 2 forklifts tend to have a much higher unit energy consumption than motorized hand lifts (class 3). The growth in the installed base is approximately 3% per year, while the UEC does not appear to be changing with time. Internal combustion engine (ICE) forklifts are also common in the commercial sector, but their energy consumption is not considered here (see ITA 2005, EPRI 1996). 65% of golf carts are electric, with an increasing percentage trend. Overall, the stock of electric golf carts increases by approximately 2% per year. 5-61 Electric burnishers are estimated to be fairly evenly distributed among building types, perhaps as a function of floor area. Their energy consumption is not considered to be significant in any one building type, and therefore the estimated 0.6 TWh/yr is grouped in the total energy for non-key building types. 5.13.2 Energy Savings Discussion The energy savings potential for non-road vehicles comes from either improving the battery efficacy, or by recharging using renewable energy sources. Non-road vehicles generally use deep-cycle batteries which are generally selected based on durability. Some deep discharge batteries may offer a lower self-discharge rate, which could be captured as energy savings potential, but may not offer the same battery life. It is unclear what the practical energy savings potential is for similarly performing batteries suited for the application. Similar deep discharge batteries are used for both forklifts and golf carts, and therefore battery technology improvements could impact the energy consumption of both. Additionally, for golf cards, we have assumed that best in class units use solar panels to offset the electric energy requirement from the building. Products are available that use this technology, and one reference suggests that the energy savings is approximately 33%. (Cruise Car 2009) We have applied this factor as the energy savings potential for golf carts, shown as energy savings potential in public assembly buildings. 5.13.3 References Cruise Car, 2009, available at: http://www.cruisecarinc.com/ EPRI, 1996, “Non-Road Electric Vehicle Market Segment Analysis,” EPRI Final Report, EPRI TR-107290, November.

TIAX estimates of office equipment usage patterns as well as their installed base in the context of various commercial building types were deduced from the LBNL (2007) study. For this study, LBNL conducted an after-hours power status survey of over 500 office equipment units in sixteen commercial buildings in three cities. Please refer to Section 6.1.4 for further details.

The highest concentration is in office, education and healthcare buildings where the largest numbers of PCs are found. Approximately 74% of the PCs in the US can be in these three building types (LBNL, 2007). This report defines office equipment as the following devices: 5-63 • Printers (impact, inkjet, laser) • Copiers • Multi-function devices – provide printing (inkjet and laser), copying & scanning services • Scanners • Fax machine (inkjet, laser, thermal) • Servers Although PCs and monitors are conventionally known and are defined as office equipment in other studies sited in this report, they are broken out individually in this study since they are significant and growing loads. As depicted in the figure below, this study shows that printers account for the most energy consumption (over half) of office equipment across the three key building types followed by servers and copiers. Servers, 16% Copiers, 15% Printers, 64% MFD, 2% Scanners, 1% Fax, 2% Servers Printers Copiers MFD Scanners Fax Figure 19: Energy Consumption breakdown for Office Equipment The large percentage of energy consumption by printers is due to both the high installed base and the relatively high average power draw of up to 77W for laser printers in standby mode (ADL 2002). Being the primary means to generate hardcopy documents from computers, printers are an integral part in the office environment. The vast majority of printers in commercial buildings are laser printers which account for about 75% of printers (ADL 2002) with the remaining being primarily inkjets and impact printers. Typically, laser printers are shared resources between multiple users in a computer network, whereas inkjet printers may serve as personal printers and thus are more commonly found in small office environments. The primary difference among the various types of printers is the mechanism in which images are generated. Laser printer consume significantly more energy then other printers (almost twice as much) due to the need for fuser rolls to be held at high temperatures to bond the toner to the paper. With other types of printers, energy is primarily used to move and operate mechanical components such as the inkjet in inkjet printers. 5-64 Copiers are similar to laser printers in terms of energy consumption in that they are also required to maintain high fuser roll temperatures and thus have high stand-by power draws. Reheating cooled fuser roll can take some time which is the main reason they consume more power during start up. Another large consumer of energy among office equipment is servers, which are computers that provide various services such as storage, database and other shared applications across a network. Servers vary in size, computation capabilities and power draw but the majority of servers in commercial buildings are workhouse and mid-range server computers running business applications and databases (ADL, 2002). An estimated 9% of the electricity consumed by commercial buildings is from office equipment (TIAX, 2002). This equipment is often shared in the office environment and most often connected to company networks. As a result, network connectivity has been found to induce energy use in equipment by remaining fully powered-up continuously even when not in active use due to the need to respond to network protocol messages. To mitigate this situation, implementing a power management proxy as described in Klamra et al. (2005) is a via solution to have connected devices enter and remain in a sleep state and wake up on when their services are needed based on a Wake-on-LAN packet trigger. The basis of the approach relies on a proxy server within the networked devices that manages the replaying of network protocol messages and act as an entity on behalf of the sleeping devices to maintain their network presence. Currently one of the major technical challenges facing power management proxy is to accurately determine if a sleeping device has left the network. Nevertheless, the energy savings from office equipment could be substantial if proxy network receives wide spread penetration. Klamra et al. (2005) estimates that if up to 25% of devices are enabled with power management proxy, around 4TWh can be saved. 5.14.2 Energy Savings Discussion Energy savings approaches for office equipment are highest impact if focused on power saving features for printers, servers and copiers, which constitute the majority of energy consumed in office equipment. Currently Energy Star performance criteria for most IT and office equipment have focused primarily on having equipment enter low-power modes after a period of inactivity as well as capping power draw values for different equipment types in low-power mode. Increasing PM-enable rates can be facilitated by network software which provides a means to centralized power management across a range of equipment interconnected via a network. Beyond power management and being more active about turning off devices, there are other methods to achieving energy savings. In the case of printers and in particular laser printers, maintaining fuser rolls at an elevated temperature could significantly reduce total laser printer as well as copier energy consumption by almost 50% (TIAX, 2004). Therefore any advances in fuser systems, including toner materials with lower melting temperature can contribute to energy savings in these devices during the stand-by mode. 5-65 In addition, since most office equipment is centered on PCs, automating device shut-down or low power mode based on PCs inactivity using smart power strips creates significant savings potential. The Smart Strip Power Strip works to switch devices on and off automatically based on a "master" PC. For example when a computer that is connected to the smart power strip goes into sleep mode, all of the peripherals (printer, monitor, etc.) will also turn off. Other models of the smart power strip also include a timer switch which shuts off connected peripherals based on the time of day. Servers, unlike PCs, do not use power management to reduce energy consumption during periods of reduced usage. However, energy savings potential exists in powering down a significant number of servers based on computation load, particular during nights and weekends when workloads decrease. Strategies that power down certain server hardware components (such a hard drives) or scale server microprocessors operating voltage/clock frequency in response to server demand can reduce energy consumption by servers in many scenarios. These strategies, however, would be most beneficial in servers exhibiting large variations in load and might not be appropriate for servers that run applications that continuously process data. 5.14.3 References ADL, 2002, “Energy Consumption by Office and Telecommunications Equipment in Commercial Buildings – Volume I: Energy Consumption Baseline,” Final Report to the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Building Technology, State and Community Programs, January.

Please refer to Section 6.1.5 for further details. 5.15.1 General Discussion Personal computers (PCs) play a vital role in today’s work environment. They come in two main form factors commonly referred to as desktops and notebooks with the former making up a majority of the installed base. This is primarily due to the higher cost of notebook PCs. Both form factors share similar physical components, including a central processing unit (CPU), power supply, motherboard, memory card, hard disk, video card, monitor, keyboard, pointing device such as a mouse and optical disk usually in the form of CD-ROM/Writer or DVD-ROM/Writer. Furthermore, the PC’s hardware capabilities can frequently be expanded by means of hardware expansion slots such as PCI and ISA in the case of desktops, PCMCIA on laptops, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices which can be found in both desktops and notebooks. The latter is becoming increasing commonplace as a means to connect additional peripherals such external drives, webcams and other human-interface devices with the PC. The digital resources of a PC are managed by an operating system (OS), which serves as the interface between the hardware and the user. In addition to being relatively low cost and high in processing power, there is a vast array of software programs written for the PC which makes it a versatile tool capable of serving the needs of a wide range of applications in various industries and occupations. As a result, PCs can be found in most work environments and thus in all building types. Generally speaking however, PCs are most abundant in settings where common PC applications are used, including: word-processors, browsers, email clients, multimedia programs, databases and spreadsheets. This is indicative of why the AEC of 25.2 TWh and installed base of PCs are highest in offices. Education and healthcare buildings are the other building 5-67 types in which the aforementioned PC applications are concentrated. In 1999, 74% of computers in the U.S. were found among office, education and healthcare buildings (LBNL, 2004) In terms of power consumption, notebooks consume considerably less compared to desktops due to the need to converse battery life. According to EPA Energy Star (2005b) and Roberson et al. (2002) a desktop can consume on average up to 75W while a notebook consumes around 25W in active mode. The hardware components that make up for the majority of the energy consumption come from the power supply losses, graphics card, and CPU. To provide some perspective, Figure 20 presents Intel’s estimates of the overall power shares of the major components of a personal computer. Monitor (17"), 55% Power Supply Losses, 22% Graphics Card, 6% CPU, 5% Drives, 4% Chipset, 1% VR, 1% Memory, 1% Other, 5% PC Energy Consumption Breakdown Figure 20: Estimated Power Budget for Personal Computer. Source Intel 2003 5.15.2 Energy Savings Discussion Currently, PCs reduce their energy consumption primarily through power management (PM). Under an industry standard specification called Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI), current operating systems provide interfaces for users to configure when and under what condition(s) their PCs go into a lower power mode. Such conditions can be a period of inactivity or when the monitors are shut-down as in the case with notebooks. Power management reduces the energy consumption of PCs by controlling the operating voltage and/or clock frequency in response to computational load obtained from the operating system. Almost all PCs possess power management with many having PM factory enabled. However, according to Korn et al. (2004) there are several reasons why an appreciable amount of PCs in commercial sector are not power managed which includes the following: historical problems with PM reliability, software incompatibility, a lack of awareness of PM, and prior myths about PM that decrease its use. Christensen et al. (2004) note that PCs often lose network connectivity when they enter a low-power mode. Many users may not accept the inconvenience of losing connectivity and, thus, disable power management to avoid this problem. It is widely known that notebook users 5-68 tend to see more value in power management because it can play a vital role in prolonging battery life, as well as alleviating the potential for overheating, especially in fan-less PCs. There is an appreciable amount of uncertainty of how many PC users in the commercial sector have PM disabled. A network-based collection of data regarding usage patterns and PM enable rates would be beneficial in yielding more detail data over longer periods of time. It is estimated that 9% of the electricity consumed by commercial buildings is from office equipment – much of it is attributed to network connected PCs (TIAX, 2002). With the increased reliance of the Internet in addition to accessing information on company networks, PCs in commercial buildings most often connected to networks. Maintaining network connectivity requires active participation on part of the host PCs. In fact, it is estimated that billions of dollars worth of electricity every year are used to keep network hosts fully powered on at all times only for the purpose of maintain network presences (Nordman et al., 2007). According a survey by Webber (2006), around 60% of office desktop PCs are left on continuously. Another source estimates that 80% and 60% of desktop and notebook PCs, respectively, have PM disabled (CCAP 2005). Network connected PCs could be asleep and saving energy a majority of the time if not for the need to maintain connectivity. To mitigate this problem, the advent of Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) has recently been introduced, which allows idle host PCs to enter a low-power sleep state and still maintain network presence. NCP, by definition, encapsulates the intelligence for maintaining network presence in an entity other than the core of the networked devices – an NCP is that entity which maintains full network presence for sleeping network hosts (Jimeno et al., 2008). In recent years, NCP have only started to penetrate into commercial buildings. Certain technical challenges still remain such as the ability to preserve existing TCP connections when a network host goes to low power mode as well as the issue of accurately determining which network packets received by a sleeping can be ignored, which require immediate reply and which can be buffered for later processing. Currently estimating the exact cost and energy savings of network connectivity poses an appreciable amount of uncertainty. According to PC Energy Report (2007), an estimate of around 17 TWh of energy can be saved from office PCs alone using NCP. Enabling PC power management and turning machines off particularly during nights and weekends can achieve extensive energy savings. Increasing consumer awareness of the benefit of power management will help significantly since consumer demand for desktops is currently centered on high performance processors rather than conserving PC power. Beyond power management, more efficient power supplies can reduce PC power draw (TIAX, 2004) and the aforementioned draft version of a new Energy Star specification for PCs also includes minimum power supply efficiencies for both internal and external ac-dc power supplies. 5.15.3 References ADL, 2002, “Energy Consumption by Office and Telecommunications Equipment in Commercial Buildings – Volume I: Energy Consumption Baseline,” Final Report to the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Building Technology, State and Community Programs, January.

Commercial units are discussed in sections 5.16.2 through 5.16.5, and residential units are covered in detail in Section 5.16.6. Commercial refrigeration is broken down into classes of equipment by the equipment family, condensing unit configuration, and the rating temperature. These categories include: Equipment Families (EERE, 2009) VOP Vertical without Doors SVO Semi-Vertical without Doors HZO Horizontal without Doors SOC Service Over Counter VCT Vertical with Transparent Doors 5-70 HCT Horizontal with Transparent Doors VCS Vertical with Solid Doors HCS Horizontal with Solid Doors Condensing Unit Configuration RC Remote Condensing Unit SC Self-Contained Condensing Unit Rating Temperature M Refrigerator (“Medium Temperature”), 38 °F L Freezer (“Low Temperature”), 0 °F I Ice Cream Freezer (“Ice Cream Temperature”), 15 °F For example, HZO.RC.L is a horizontal unit without doors that uses a remote condensing unit and is rated for low temperatures. For the purposes of this study, TIAX used definitions that centered on the condensing unit configuration. “warehouse” and “central” refrigeration both use remote condensing units, while “commercial units” use self-contained condensing units. “Walk-in” refrigeration does not fit in the above class definitions, and is broken out separately in this study. A summary of refrigeration is shown below in Figure 22. Starred table entries (*) indicate that the specific load was not studied in depth because it was not believed to be a key load for a given building type. It does not necessarily indicate a value of zero. Table 22: Refrigeration Annual Energy Consumption (TWh/yr) for key sub-types across all building types.

Unlike many data sources, TIAX includes small grocery stores in calculations – UEC is much smaller as a result 5.16.2.1 General Discussion Typical supermarket central refrigeration systems can consume as much as 1-1.5 million kWh per year, which is generally about half of the energy consumption of the entire building (Baxter, ORNL). Of the total refrigeration load, 60-70% is for condensers and evaporators, and the remainder is for fans, lighting, defrosting, and anti-sweat heaters (Baxter, ORNL). Unlike other types of refrigeration, central refrigeration is unique to food sales buildings as defined by CBECS. Specifically this includes markets and grocery stores – convenience stores are generally not large enough to make central refrigeration economically viable. As defined by the Food Marketing Institute (FMI, 2008), a supermarket has greater than $2MM in annual sales (~35,400 in the US as of 2008). While convenience stores may also clear $2MM in annual sales, they often do so by selling gasoline as their primary product – their grocery selections are often limited to high-convenience items. For years supermarkets have been designing high efficiency systems. The extreme costs of refrigeration on such a large scale motivates larger capital expenditures during building construction to minimize the impact of electricity costs on profits for years to come (ADL, 2002) In 2002, ADL described a typical full size supermarket with a multiplex refrigeration system as follows: • Average full service store is 60,000 square feet • Average design loads: o low temperature - 330,000 Btu/hr, average 80 horsepower o medium temperature - 1,150,000 Btu/hr, average 175 horsepower • Average electric load is 440 kW, 55%-57% of which (245 kW) is used to operate refrigeration equipment • 1.2 million kWh/year is consumed by refrigeration equipment • The average compressor duty cycle is 85% for low temperature and 55% for medium temperature (ADL, 2002) In 2008, NREL updated this assessment: • Average full service store is 42,000 sq ft • Compressor-racks consisting of: two low-temp racks for frozen foods, ice cream, and walk-in freezers, and two medium-temp racks for meat, dairy, and deli cases and walk-in units (Hale, 2008). • Breakdown of refrigeration units as shown in Table 24 5-72 Table 24: Typical supermarket breakdown of units by type Case/Walk-in Type Total Length (ft) Percentage Island single deck meat 108 8.6% Multi-deck Dairy/Deli 264 20.9% Vertical Frozen Food with Doors 270 21.4% Island Single Deck Ice Cream 120 9.5% Walk-In Cooler (Med-Temp) 375 29.7% Walk-in Freezer (Low-Temp) 125 9.9% As Figure 21 shows, the vast majority of food sales buildings are less than 5000 sq ft in size. However, the energy consumption for refrigeration increases dramatically as size increases. So while there are numerous stores that are greater than 100,000 sq ft that consume close to two million kWh for their refrigeration needs every year, the average is significantly less. Food Sales Buildings Size Distribution 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 <5 <10 <25 <50 <100 <200 <500 Size (1000 sqft) Quantity of Buildings (1000s) 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 Annual Avg Energy Consumption per Building (Million Kwh/yr) Convenience Stores Convenience Stores w /Gas Grocery Stores Other Refrigeration Electric Load Pow er (Refrigeration Electric Load) Figure 21: The vast majority of food sales buildings are less than 5000 sq ft in size, and the only subgroup of any significance at larger sizes is grocery stores (EIA, 2006). 5-73 Figure 22: Layout of a typical multiplex refrigeration system in a supermarket (Walker, Foster-Miller). A multiplexed refrigeration system is the standard type of system in a supermarket. The general layout, as shown in Figure 22, consists of a remote machine room where racks of compressors are mounted in parallel. This configuration allows for greater load control for varying system needs, and consistent cycling of all compressors. The refrigerant flows through hundreds of feet of piping to evaporators located in each of the refrigerated units on the sales floor. Heat is rejected though remote (often rooftop) condenser units after passing through hundreds of additional feet of piping. Generally the condenser units are air-cooled because of the low up front capital investment required. For the purposes of this study, TIAX assumes that convenience stores, though they may have significant electricity loads for refrigeration, do not use central refrigeration systems. These buildings tend to have most refrigerated beverages in merchandiser units and potentially a few units for dairy products including refrigerated items like milk, and frozen items like ice cream. This refrigeration is generally done with unit coolers/freezers or walk-in units with outward facing merchandiser doors (see Section 5.16.4). 5.16.2.2 Energy Savings Discussion The use of evaporative condensers instead of air-cooled condensers can provide an 8.2% savings on energy consumption (Baxter, ORNL). The evaporation causes the water temperature to approach the air’s wet bulb temperature which is significantly lower than the dry bulb temperature. As a result of a lower heat sink temperature, the systems head pressure can be lowered, increasing efficiency, or the condenser size can be decreased, lowering system costs (ADL, 1996) 5-74 Distributed compressor systems also provide room for efficiency gains. Instead of using a centralized compressor stage, this type of system uses individual compressors in each unit. Scroll compressors are often utilized to reduce noise and vibration (Baxter, ORNL). While they are slightly less efficient in refrigeration applications, the fact that scroll compressors have no valves in them allows for lower condensing temperatures, thereby boosting the overall efficiency of the system. Heat is rejected in this system through each unit’s own liquid cooled condenser. The heat rejection fluid loop connects all the units in the building to a centralized chiller. Because the heat rejection loop can be glycol or another fluid, a major benefit of this system is a 50% reduction in charge size assuming liquid-cooled condensing is used. Overall, a distributed compressor system can reduce electricity consumption by 11-12% (Baxter, ORNL and Walker, Foster-Miller). ORNL’s analysis of advanced energy saving techniques in supermarket refrigeration also discusses low-charge multiplex systems, and secondary loop systems. These systems, when coupled with evaporative condensers, were able to achieve 11.6% and 10.4% energy savings, respectively. In addition to high level system design improvements, there are several smaller energy saving measures that are more targeted at improvements at the component level. While generally more associated with stand-alone commercial or residential units, they apply to central systems as well. In their recent NREL study, Hale describes many of these measures, including: • High-efficiency fans • Reduced lighting power (LED and CFL) • Anti-sweat heater controls • High-efficiency anti-sweat heaters • Alternative defrost systems • Addition of night-covers or doors to open cases By incorporating the above features, Hale concludes that load can be reduced for a specific unit as follows: Based on the breakdown of units from Figure 24 and the potential savings from Figure 25, TIAX estimates that these measures could reduce the system’s energy consumption by 15%. 5-75 Table 25: Central refrigeration energy savings potential by unit type (Hale, 2008) Savings Potential Unit type With listed measures Replace with vertical, closed door unit Low-temperature, vertical unit with doors 40% - Multi-deck dairy/deli case 14% 82% Single-deck ice cream case 36% 54% The most effective method for achieving high efficiency at the unit level is to switch out all open cases to high-efficiency vertical cases with doors. This however comes with certain usability changes that some stores may be less inclined to accept (Hale, 2008). In its analysis of energy savings potential, ADL provides a breakdown by specific technologies (see Table 26). Taking into account various competing technologies and the percentage of applicable supermarkets based on size and type, the total potential savings becomes 24%. Table 26: Incorporating various factors of supermarkets across the country, the total potential energy savings for the average supermarket refrigeration system is 24%.

This includes: • 24% savings estimate from ADL system-level improvements • 17% savings by replacement of Multi-deck dairy/deli units (82% savings on 21% of units – See Table 24 and Table 25) • 5% savings by replacement of Single-deck ice cream units (54% savings on 9.5% of units – See Table 24 and Table 25) TIAX does not include savings achieved by adding strip curtains (24 hr/day impact) or night covering shields (impact only when store is closed) to open units because the sav- 5-76 ings is less that what could be achieved by replacing the open units with high-efficiency closed units (SCE, 1997 and Energy Star Building Manual, 2009). For the purposes of this study, a ‘Best-in-class’ unit will not be a specific unit, but rather a generic system that is 46% better than the current typical unit that is used today. 5.16.2.3 References ADL, 1996, “Energy Savings Potential for Commercial Refrigeration Equipment,” Arthur D.

Also, UEC and applicability of various savings measures varies significantly from system to system. 5.16.3.1 General Discussion Warehouse refrigeration systems are similar to supermarket “central” systems in their scale, but instead of piping refrigerant to various units throughout the building, the warehouse refrigeration cools an entire building or a portion of a building. It is common for different goods to need different storage temperatures; for example, ice cream is frequently stored at 15°F, while other frozen goods are stored at 0°F, and refrigerated items are as high as 38 to 40°F. The incredible energy intensity of these buildings is more akin to large scale HVAC in both concept and implementation than to other refrigeration systems. An Alaska Sea Grant study points out that the design temperatures are important to energy consumption beyond the direct costs for electricity; for many goods, including seafood, the colder the temperature, the longer the storage life (Cole, 2004). It is therefore vital to appropriately balance the increased costs of decreasing the set point temperature with the increased revenue potential associated with increased storage life. 5.16.3.2 Energy Savings Discussion Lekov et al., in a 2009 study estimated the potential savings breakdown by system components, including the condenser, evaporator, compressor, and the building shell (insulation, doors, etc). The results are shown below in Figure 23. 5-78 Evaporator, 54% Condenser, 12% Shell, 3% Compressors, 34% Potential Energy Savings Breakdown Figure 23: Advances in evaporators are estimated to account for 54% of all energy savings in warehouse refrigeration. In 2008, a PIER study for the CEC surveyed California refrigerated warehouses in part to understand energy consumption and the various measures being used to reduce the consumption. They asked about the use of 11 different energy saving measures • Upgraded insulation (UI) • Cool roofs (CR) • Efficient lighting technology (ELT) • Aggressive evaporative condenser (AEC) • Thermo siphon oil cooling (TSC) • Computer control (CC) • Compressor variable frequency drive (Comp VFD) • Condenser variable frequency drive (Cond VFD) • Evaporator variable frequency drive (Evap VFD) • Floating head pressure (FHP) • Sensor controlled doors (SCD) Only five of the 11 measures were found in more than 50% of buildings, indicating that there is significant room for improvement in energy consumption. The percentage of surveyed buildings that contained each energy savings measure is shown below in Figure 24. 5-79 Use of Energy Conserving Technologies 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Cool Roofs Compressor VFD Control Sensor Controlled Doors Evaporator VFD Control Thermo-Siphon Oil Cooling Condenser VFD Control Floating Head Pressure Upgraded Insulation Efficient Lighting Computer Control Aggressive Evap Condenser % of Warehouses Surveyed Figure 24: PIER study findings on use of energy saving technologies in refrigerated warehouses Lekov et al, discusses additional energy saving measures, but does not estimate potential savings. These include Fast-Acting Doors for reducing air infiltration, improved defrost control, improved part-load performance, and load-shedding or duty cycling which allows the system to be shut off when the temperature is within a specific range around the set point (Lekov, 2009) (Black, 2008). While the PIER study does not analyze a “best-in-class” system or give a potential energy savings, estimates from other sources indicate a 35% potential decrease in refrigeration load with implementation of the various available technologies (PG&E, 2009). ADL‘s 1996 study of commercial refrigeration gives an even more optimistic view on warehouse refrigeration (ADL, 1996). The study does not specifically discuss warehouse refrigeration, but given the similarities to walk-in refrigeration, one can get an idea of the energy saving measures that might be available if the system were scaled to warehouse size. TIAX assumes however that the PG&E estimate is more realistic at this time because in the years since the ADL study, many of these measures have already been implemented in refrigerated warehouses (lowering applicability of savings measures to a ‘typical’ unit). The energy consumption is so large in these situations that companies tend to upgrade their systems sooner than the owner of a walk-in unit would do. The potential economic impact creates an incentive to upgrade to energy saving technologies very quickly. For the purposes of this study, TIAX assumes that a best in class warehouse refrigeration system has a 35% lower electric load than a typical unit. 5.16.3.3 References ADL, 1996, “Energy Savings Potential for Commercial Refrigeration Equipment,” Arthur D.

Best UEC data are from 1997 which is likely to be on the high side. 5.16.4.1 General Discussion Walk-in refrigeration is commonly used in the food sales and service industries. Their large capacity is useful for short term storage of perishable goods before shelving in a store or prior to preparation in a restaurant. Typical units used in food sales and service are approximately 160 square feet in floor space (ADL, 1996). In food sales, another configuration is also often used where one side of the walk-in unit contains display cases that face outwards. These combination units help store owners with little floor space to make good use of their square footage by combining refrigeration units 5-81 together. Additionally, it reduces shelf stocking time and keeps aisles from being blocked since all stocking is done from the rear with products that are presumably already very close at hand. Though it can be an efficient use of the area, the loads can fluctuate more frequently as doors are opened on an irregular and potentially frequent basis by customers. While Walk-in units are not exclusive to food industry buildings, it is generally exclusive to the food industry itself. That is, even though small percentages of all non-food related building types have walk-in refrigeration (see data below in Figure 25), the use is almost always for restaurants, cafés, convenience stores, or other food related businesses that reside in the building. Commercial Buildings (by type) with Walk-in Refrigeration Units 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% Retail and Service Food Sales Food Service Education Warehouse Health Care Public AOR Lodging Percentage of Buildings 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Number of Buildings (000s) Percentage Quantity *Retail excludes both strip and enclosed malls Figure 25: Walk-in refrigeration is most common in buildings in the food industry. As shown in Figure 25, greater than 70% of food sales and service buildings have walk-in refrigeration, accounting for greater than 60% of the commercial buildings in the US with walk-in refrigeration, and 55% of the total US installed base. 5.16.4.2 Energy Savings Discussion ADL outlines a number of energy saving measures at various stages of market penetration, including: Thick insulation, Economizer Cooling, floating head pressure, high efficiency lighting and fans, and advanced defrost and anti-sweat systems (ADL, 1996). Some of the most applicable ones include: • High Efficiency Fans and lighting – The use of ECM evaporator/condenser fan motors and electronic ballasted fluorescent lights, as with many forms of refrigeration, can provide important savings. • Floating head pressure – With floating head pressure, the pressure ratio is significantly lower for a good portion of the year while still providing the same reliable service. While it is standard to then run the condenser fan continuously 5-82 with this setup, the tradeoff of lower compressor energy consumption more than counters this energy consumption. • Economizer Cooling – by utilizing cold outdoor air in northern climates to reduce cooling load, ADL estimates that compressor electricity can be reduced by up to 26% (based on a unit in Minneapolis) • External Heat Rejection – By locating the condenser (or entire condensing unit) outside in cold environments, the compressor duty cycle can be reduced. In addition, during warmer times of year, this can also provide additional savings through reduced space conditioning loads.

Their analysis weighed the applicability of each technology for the two different temperature levels as well its usage in combination with other technologies. 5.16.4.3 References ADL, 1996, “Energy Savings Potential for Commercial Refrigeration Equipment,” Arthur D.

Sources vary in definition of ‘commercial units’ 5.16.5.1 General Discussion Energy of commercial refrigerators varies significantly depending on the intended application; a common, typical unit is approximately 44 to 48 cu ft, has two doors, and is a reachin style unit (ACEEE, 2004). Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s Food Service Technology Center (FSTC) for example, tested a typical unit that had 44 cu ft of usable space (FSTC, 1999). In this self-contained commercial refrigerator category there are many configurations: there are roll-in units which have floors that are flush to the ground for rolling carts into, pass-through units which have doors on opposing sides, glass-door and mixed door units that allow people to see the contents, and beverage merchandisers which are designed specifically for holding cold beverages for sale. Commercial refrigeration units are used in a wide variety of buildings. They are concentrated in the food industry, but since restaurants and cafes are routinely located in a variety of buildings, so are commercial refrigerator and freezer units. CBECS gives some insight into where they are used with the data in Figure 26. The highest numbers are in food related buildings and the least are in offices and warehouses. 5-84 Commercial Buildings (by type) with Commercial Refrigeration Units 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Office Retail and Service Food Sales Food Service Education Health Care Public AOR Percentage of Buildings 0 50 100 150 200 250 Number of Buildings (000s) Percentage Quantity *Retail excludes both strip and enclosed malls Figure 26: Food related buildings have the most commercial refrigeration units, but retail and service and public AOR buildings are also notable in terms of quantity. 5.16.5.2 Energy Savings Discussion Energy Star V1.0 criteria (shown below in Table 31) for solid-door only commercial refrigerators is currently in effect. V2.0 will go into effect starting on January 1, 2010. As an early exception, glass-door and mixed-door units which could never before be certified can now be tested to meet the new criteria. This began on April 1, 2009. Table 31: The current, V1.0 criteria for Energy Star certification of commercial refrigerators Product Type Energy Star Criteria Refrigerators <= 0.10V + 2.04 kWh/day Freezers <= 0.40V + 1.38 kWh/day Refrigerator-Freezers <= 0.27AV - 0.71 kWh/day Ice Cream Freezers <= 0.39V + 0.82 kWh/day Where AV = Adjusted volume = (1.63 x freezer volume in ft3 ) + refrigerator volume in ft3 The V2.0 criteria are shown below in Table 32. 5-85 Table 32: The new criteria, v2.0 for Energy Star certification of commercial refrigerators went info effect on April 1, 2009 for glass door units, and will go into effect on January 1, 2010 for solid door units.

Additionally more efficient blades can be employed to improve efficacy of the unit. • High efficiency compressors – newer scroll and linear compressors can improve efficiency over traditional refrigeration compressors. • High efficiency lighting – Incandescent bulbs give off large amounts of heat and thereby force the refrigerator to work harder to maintain its temperature. Instead, use compact fluorescent bulbs which will reduce electricity consumption for lighting by up to 75% (Energy Star CFL, 2009), and will last 10 times longer than the incandescent bulb. • Improved defrosting designs – o Hot-gas defrost, like hot gas anti-sweat heaters is a new technology that uses hot compressor gas for the defrosting process o Improved defrost cycle monitoring can improve efficiency by only defrosting when necessary, and for optimal periods of time. This can be achieved by monitoring variables including the cumulative amount of time the door is open and the number of times it is opened. 5-86 o Hot-gas activated evaporation of condensate eliminates the need for high power heaters. This feature eliminates the need to attach the unit to a drain during installation. • Improved insulation – o Wall insulation is commonly ~1.5 inches thick, but new more efficient units are going as thick as 2.5 inches. o Alternative varieties of insulation, such as foamed-in-place insulation o Improved glass doors are available that utilize low-E, multi layer glass and multiple glazing layers to reduce heat loss. While purchasing an Energy Star compliant unit is important, the energy consumption relies heavily on the usage of the unit. Many important things can be done to ensure the refrigerator or freezer operates at or below the specified energy consumption: • Buy appropriate size for a given application – If the unit is oversized for a user’s needs, it will use more energy than necessary, since it must cool a larger volume. The empty space is rapidly warmed with each opening of the door, resulting in greater energy consumption and more temperature fluctuations. • Buy solid-door units if possible – While glass-door units are preferable in many retail situations to allow customers to see all the products, they are not as energy efficient, and should be avoided if it is not necessary. • Maintain seals appropriately – Well maintained seals ensure that heat is not exchanged through gaps in the seals. This is a cost-effective method for maintaining like-new performance in older units. • Locate unit for max efficiency – Refrigerator units located next to hot stoves or ovens or even located in direct sunlight are forced to consume more energy to maintain the desired internal temperature. Best in Class Since commercial refrigerator and freezer efficiency depends so much on volume, specifying a single Best in Class (BIC) unit does not incorporate the variation. In analyzing the Energy Star qualifying commercial refrigerator units, TIAX found that the top tier units were able to achieve UECs as low as 50% better than the Energy Star (ES) qualifying value. Table 27, below, shows the full spectrum of Energy Star refrigerators, as well as the ES limit and the region that encompasses the top tier units (>45% improvement over ES). 5-87 Energy Star (ES) Qualifying Commercial Refrigerators 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 5,000 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Internal Volume (cu ft) UEC (Kwh/yr) ES Qualifying Limit 45% Better than ES level Typical unit Best In Class Figure 27: The ‘Best in Class’ region marks the most energy efficient units on the market across all sizes. The BIC is assumed to be 50% better than the Energy Star qualifying limit. Similarly, Table 28 shows ES qualifying commercial freezers, the ES qualifying limit, and highlights the top tier units (>40% improvement over ES). In this case, the best units are approximately 45% better than the base ES unit. Energy Star (ES) Qualifying Commercial Freezers 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Internal Volume (cu ft) UEC (Kwh/yr) ES Qualifying Limit 40% Better than ES level Typical unit Best In Class Figure 28: The most efficient commercial freezers achieve 45% better UEC than the base Energy Star Unit. According to Energy Star, the best in class unit has 38 cu ft of space, and only uses 1088 kWh of electricity in a year, which is almost 50% less than the Energy Star rating of 2130 5-88 kWh/yr. To do this, it utilizes many of the previously described technologies, including: high efficiency defrost system, fluorescent lighting, and condensate elimination with a hot gas system. TIAX assumes that the BIC commercial refrigerator unit is 62% more efficient than the baseline conventional unit. This takes into account the BIC refrigerator and freezer from the Energy Star qualified listing (ES Commercial list, 2009) by taking weighted averages based on the associated installed base. The BIC refrigerators and freezers are 67% and 56% more efficient, respectively, than the conventional units. Combining this value using the installed base split of 60% refrigerators and 40% freezers gives a total savings of 62%. 5.16.5.3 References ACEEE, 2004, “Emerging Technologies and Practices: 2004,” American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Out of the eighteen styles as specified by NAECA and as used in Energy Star, the Canadian Office of Energy Efficiency (COEE) studies and other organizations, the seven most common are shown below in Table 34 along with each style’s associated Energy star rating. These categories are based on three variables: configuration (i.e. freezer on top, freezer on the side, etc), automatic or manual defrost, and whether or not it has through-the-door ice service. Table 34: Energy star standards for seven types of residential refrigerator-freezers (ES ratings, 2009) Style category Style Category Description UEC (kWh/yr) 1 Manual Defrost Refrigerators 407 2 Partial Automatic Defrost Refrigerators 407 3 Top Mount Freezer without through-the-door ice 452 4 Side Mount Freezer without through-the-door ice 541 5 Bottom Mount Freezer without through-the-door ice 492 6 Top Mount Freezer with through-the-door ice 529 7 Side Mount Freezer with through-the-door ice 570 While significant sales are represented by all seven categories, a 2007 COEE study found that almost two thirds of refrigerators sold in 2005 are type three (3), that is, they have “automatic defrost and top-mounted freezer, but [do not have] through-the-door ice service.” (Lindia, 2007). The energy consumption of this type of refrigerator is ~450 kWh/yr. Not only is this amongst the lowest of all types of refrigerators, it also indicates that most of these units are at or below the Energy Star standard consumption level. Unfortunately, trends over the last 20 years have shown dramatic increases in sales of units with higher energy consumption, namely the side by side refrigerator-freezers with automatic defrost, and through-the-door ice service (Lindia, 2007). These units can consume 600+ kWh/yr, or more than 33% more than units with top-mounted freezers and no ice service. Overall, however, the energy consumption trends are decreasing consistently every year. Lindia reported that both the unit types above reduced energy consumption by approximately half between 1990 and 2005. It is important to note that while energy consumption of the new units is quite good, the life of a refrigerator can be close to two decades and therefore the average unit currently being used actually has much higher energy consumption than those currently on the mar- 5-90 ket. While industry estimates vary for the life expectancy of refrigerators, the numbers in Table 35, below, from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers is believe to be a good approximation. Table 35: Approximate Life Expectancy of Refrigerators by type (AHAM, 1996) Type Life (yrs) Side By Side 14 Top Mount 14 Bottom Mount 17 One Door 19 Built In 14 Compact 5 Chest Freezer 18 Upright Freezer 15 Lindia found that since 1990, the average UEC of residential refrigerators has fallen by 50% or more in almost every category. Figure 29, below, shows the Unit Energy Consumption of Types 3, 5 and 7 between 1990 and 2005 to show the significant improvements in efficiency. Avg Annual Unit Energy Consumption of Refrigerators by Model Year 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 Unit Energy Consumption (UEC - Kwh/yr) Type 3 Type 7 Type 5 Figure 29: The energy consumption of the 3 most common types of residential refrigerators have dropped by almost half since 1990 (Lindia, 2007). Over the last two decades, sales have gradually trended towards larger units. The most common size group, 16.5 cu ft to 18.4 cu ft is still the most popular group, but sales of those smaller have decreased, and sales of those larger have increased. Figure 30, below, shows this trend using data from all residential refrigerator sales, including both those for commercial and residential use. TIAX assumes for this study that the typical size of full size units is the same for all sectors. 5-91 Residential Refrigerator Market Breakdown by Volume (all sales) 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% <10.5 10.5–12.4 12.5–14.4 14.4–16.4 16.5–18.4 18.5–20.4 >20.5 Volume (Cu ft) Percentage of Annual Sales (%) 1995 2005 Figure 30: Of all Residential Refrigerators, the most common sizes are between 16.5 and 18.4 cubic feet in volume (Lindia, 2007). Compact Units A compact unit is defined as one that has less than 7.75 cu ft adjusted capacity and is less than 36” tall (ES calculations, 2009). Given their size, compact residential refrigerators are common in the workplace for storing lunch or other small items. Their usage varies significantly by building type however, since many commercial areas, such as retail stores are not conducive to storing of employee food. In comparison to full size refrigerators, compact units are fairly inefficient on a by-volume basis. There is, to a certain extent, an economy of scale with refrigerators, meaning that size is not linearly proportional to energy consumption. While full size refrigerators have advanced significantly in the last 20 years, compact units have by in large remained the same in terms of efficiency (Lindia, 2007). Figure 31 shows a comparison of the UEC of compact units to that of the average of all units over the last two decades. This is partially due to the fact that their overall impact is much lower due to their lower UEC. Appliance manufacturers and regulatory bodies have focused on areas with the most potential for energy savings and compact refrigerators are less likely to have as significant of a net impact. Additionally, due to their sizes, compact refrigerators often have more limited features and therefore efficiency gains can only come from a few restricted areas: better compressors and heat exchanger technology or better insulation and door sealing methods. For compact refrigerators, the vast majority are NAECA Type 11 (Lindia, 2007). 5-92 Avg Annual Unit Energy Consumption of Refrigerators by Model Year 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 Year Unit Energy Consumption (UEC - Kwh/yr) Type 11 - Compact Weighted Average - all units Figure 31: While the energy consumption of the average residential refrigerator has decreased significantly in recent decades, the compact refrigerators have stayed relatively the same. The COEE estimates that compact units are only 6.4% of the total (residential and commercial) market (Lindia, 2007). In commercial settings however, it is significantly higher due to very different usage patterns between work and home environments. 5.16.6.2 Energy Savings Discussion Energy Star standards for full size refrigerators and freezers are calculated as 20% less than the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) standard. Since these standards vary by unit type (i.e. configuration types 1-15), achieving the actual target UEC often appears to be a compromise between functionality and energy consumption. By providing multiple standards, Energy Star has recognized that one feature set does not match up with the needs of all consumers. NAECA standards are calculated by using the “adjusted volume” in a set formula for each configuration: Adjusted Volume (AV) For refrigerators - AV = (Fresh Volume) + 1.63 x (Freezer Volume) For freezers - AV = 1.73 x (Freezer Volume) where “Fresh Volume” is the total volume of the main refrigerator compartment, and “Freezer Volume” is the total volume of the freezer compartment. (ES Standards, 2009) Energy Star standard calculates the UEC energy consumption for a type 3 unit as follows (NAECA 2009): UEC = (1-0.20) *( 9.80*AV+276) 5-93 Best in Class Many brands have units that do 30+% better than the most lenient Energy Star standard for energy consumption (Type 7 standard - side by side refrigerator/freezer units with through-door ice). Figure 32 shows a plot of all Energy Star qualifying units and highlights the top tier units that can achieve 30+% less energy consumption than the most lenient Energy star standard. Energy Star (ES) Qualifying Residential Refrigerators and Refrigerator/Freezers 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Adjusted Volume (cu ft) UEC (Kwh/yr) Type 7 ES Limit (most lenient) 30% Better than ES7 Level Type 3 ES Limit Type 5 ES Limit Best In Class Typical Unit Compact Full Size Figure 32: Energy consumption of Energy star qualifying residential refrigerators The key features for best in class include: • Improved insulation • Improved seals and maintenance of seals • Location of unit - not in sun, not next to stove, enough space for hot air to escape • No through-door ice service • Top mounted freezer, not side by side • Reasonable size (<20 cu ft is best) For best in class energy consumption, TIAX assumes 462 kWh/yr for full size units and 300 kWh/yr for compact units. 5.16.6.3 References ACEEE, 2004, “Emerging Technologies and Practices: 2004,” American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

To a certain extent, this is due to a wide range of data center configurations between companies. In his 2007 report, Jonathan Koomey points out that the top level figures reported in the industry tend to obscure these variations (Koomey, 2007). Each application differs in its processing, memory, and storage needs. For example, for search indexing, advertisement and search result serving, and ‘cloud’ based application companies generally utilize hundreds of thousands of “volume servers. However, on the other end of the spectrum are high intensity processing applications that require large, high-end servers which can consume as much as 100 times as much power as a volume server. In newer configurations, some companies are packaging as many as 1,160 of these volume servers into a single 1AAA shipping container to use as a standard module in building their facilities (CNET, 2009). Each container consumes up to 250 kW at peak load (Data Centers, 2009) and each data center may contain more than 40 containers for a total of more than 45,000 servers (Data Center, 2009) and 10 MW in energy consumption (Google, 2009). Anecdotal evidence indicates that in total, a company like this may have upwards of 450,000 servers in total (Web Servers, 2009). Initial reports indicate that significantly larger facilities are currently being planned and built – some with energy intensities of nearly 1 kWh/sq ft. Uncertainty surrounding the total impact of data centers is also nebulous due to the desire for many large companies to protect the intellectual property that surrounds their designs for servers and data centers. The ability to design an efficient data center represents a significant business advantage over their competitors. Independent companies have collected as much data as possible on server counts for large internet companies, but all the largest continue to keep all their information private. 5-96 5.17.2 Energy Savings Discussion Significant advances are available in the area of energy savings for data centers, and as a result of the high energy intensities of these facilities, there is great economic motivation to implement these strategies. A given facility may consume electricity at a rate of a few megawatts or more of steady load. Achieving small gains in efficiency can therefore make large impacts in the expenses of the company. One measure of efficiency for these centers is the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) which is simply a ratio of total energy consumption to energy consumption used for actual computing. For example, if a data center uses 1.5 megawatts, and 0.5 megawatts is used for cooling and lighting, then the PUE is 1.5/1 or 1.5. Recently published information indicates that some companies are running their most efficient data centers with a PUE as low as 1.12 (CNET, 2009). These low statistics are generally achieved through reductions in both supply and demand for HVAC. That is, in addition to highly efficient cooling, the servers are designed to operate at higher average temperatures thereby imparting lower cooling loads on the system. While a low PUE means that less energy is being used on non-primary end uses for the company, the statistic says very little about the efficiency of the servers. To save energy at the server level, the main technologies with the largest impact include: • High efficiency power supplies – by converting to better power supplies (up to 90% efficiency) from conventional units (60-70% efficiency), significant energy savings can be achieved. Unlike PCs, loads can be relatively well anticipated on a server, thereby allowing for more appropriately sized power supplies which are generally more efficient. The additional benefit is that with higher efficiency, the units will dissipate less energy as heat, thereby requiring lower cooling loads from the HVAC system. (Hoelzle, 2006) • System level power management – many data centers do not have uniform load over the course of a day, week, etc. Power management (i.e. an idle or sleep mode) could be enabled on subsets of servers that are not currently be used, and the subset could be rotated to ensure even usage and maintain consistent life. • Processor level power management – processor manufacturers all have the ability to implement power management schemes into the processor such that clock speeds are varied depending on requirements of the operating system. Upgrading to the latest technologies would improve partial load energy consumption. • Decreased cooling requirements and passive cooling – while major focus is put on savings in building HVAC, savings can also be achieved on individual servers. Passive cooling systems, including innovative heat sink systems can reduce the per-server load by not requiring the use of built in cooling fans. More efficient system fans can effectively pull heat from the heat sinks, thus transferring some of the load to HVAC, and eliminating some of the load. 5-97 TIAX estimates that by incorporating these currently available technologies, energy consumption could be reduced by 19% (weighted average between various classes of servers). 5.17.3 References Data Centers, 2009, Miller, Rich, “Google Unveils its Container Data Center,” Data Center Knowledge, April, 2009 downloaded on October 12, 2009 from http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/04/01/google-unveils-itscontainer-data-center/ Google, 2009, “Google Efficient Data Center Summit,” YouTube Video Downloaded on October 12, 2009 from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRwPSFpLX8I Hoelzle, Urs and Weihl, Bill, 2006, “High-efficiency power supplies for home computers and servers,” Google inc, downloaded on October 20, 2009 from http://services.google.com/blog_resources/PSU_white_paper.pdf Koomey, 2007, “Estimating Total Power Consumption by Servers in the U.S. and the World,” Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, February 2007.

Data Uncertainties Adoption and energy savings potential of power management in slot machines. 5.18.1 General Discussion Slot machines are one of the most popular gambling methods in casinos; they constitute about 70% of the average casino’s income (Cooper, 2005). Once primarily built on me- 5-98 chanical mechanisms, modern slot machines are almost completely computerized. They are equipped with digitally pulsed step motors to turn and stop each reel, monitors to display games, speakers, specialized electronics and random number generators to ensure the fairness of each play. Due to the legal restrictions on gambling, slot machines are only found in certain licensed establishments with the vast majority concentrated in commercial casinos, which most often are an extension of hotels or resorts. With most casinos operating twenty-four hours a day and year round, slot machines are assumed to be continuously on (Underdahl et al., 2009) often with elaborate lighting, displays and sound to attract gamblers. As a result, slot machines are estimated to consume up to about 2.7TWh annually. 5.18.2 Energy Savings Discussion Since current slot machines are almost always actively on, implementing any level of power management could result in appreciable energy savings. However, it is vital that power management does not interfere with certain essential features such as security to prevent fraudulent transaction and the need to attract and attain potential users. For example, in casinos potential users are often people who are passing by the gaming machines and whose attentions are often drawn to a machine because of strategic lighting, sounds and display known as “attraction sequences” (Underdahl et al., 2009). Furthermore, most users have little patience to wait for machines to power up if they are initially shut off. Underdahl et al. (2009) has applied for a patent describing a method for wager gaming machine to have software and components to allow for automatic powering on and off of machine components via a network interface (also referred to as remote out-of-band power control). Most games and slot machines have numerous components, such as displays, lights, coin acceptors, disk drives, card-readers, bill acceptors, printers, card readers, motor controller, and light controller all of which consume power. In a preferred embodiment described in their application, the power consumption control system of the invention controls power consumption of machines by controlling the power provided to their selected components, rather than by cutting off power to the entire gaming machine (Underdahl et al., 2009). The patent application claims that it is foreseeable that power consumption in gaming machines can be reduced by up 40%. 5.18.3 References Cooper, M., 2005, "How slot machines give gamblers the business".

TVs are ubiquitous in residential homes and are the highest energy consuming MEL in homes as reported in TIAX (2008). TVs are common in commercial buildings, but are generally less widespread than they are in homes. Additionally, there are also far fewer commercial buildings than residential buildings. Televisions can be divided into analog and digital devices. Even after the switch to digital broadcast, there remains a significant installed base of analog TVs in homes. However, it is assumed that in commercial buildings that digital TVs (DTVs) account for the bulk of the installed base. Digital TVs can use any number of display technologies including traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) screens. Digital projection TVs use liquid crystal display (LCD), digital light processing (DLP), and liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) display technology. Flat-panel direct-view DTVs use either LCD or plasma display technology. While there is some data on the breakdown of installed TV technologies and screen sizes in residential homes, there 5-100 is considerable uncertainty on this breakdown in commercial buildings. It is generally assumed that the majority of TVs in commercial buildings are flat panel displays, which have dominated DTV sales for the past several years, but there may be analog and front projection DTVs in certain commercial building types. Television energy consumption can be characterized by two operating modes: active mode (when the TV displays an image), and off mode (when the screen is off). TVs, like many other electronics, continue to draw power while they are “off”. Typically, televisions draw power while in off mode so they can respond to a signal from a remote. Memory and time-keeping functions also require power while the TV is off. Although active mode power draw increases with screen size, screen size does not have an impact on off mode power draw. Digital TVs may have cooling fans that remain on for some period after the TV has been switched off. This intermediate power draw and its energy impact are not well understood, but at this time likely does not have a significant impact on overall TV energy consumption. Generally, active mode dominates the energy consumption of TVs, accounting for approximately 90% of the total. However, the active mode percentage can be even higher for larger screen TVs or TVs that exhibit higher than average usage. The main factor contributing to the active mode power draw is the screen size (see TIAX 2007). Similar size DTVs of different technologies also affects the power draw. Other factors include the manufacturer, resolution, and brightness and contrast settings. Television usage in commercial buildings will vary considerably depending on the type of commercial building. For example, TV usage in food service buildings (e.g., restaurants and bars) will generally be higher than usage in lodging. In all cases, there is a high degree of uncertainty around TV usage, due to the lack of data. 5.19.2 Energy Savings Discussion Active mode accounts for approximately 90% of total TV AEC. TV active mode power draw generally increases with screen area. Consequently, a straightforward way to reduce TV AEC would be to reduce the screen size. TV display technology and brightness also impact the active mode power draw for a TV. In practice, however, these traits are desirable product attributes that consumers clearly value. Consequently, these measures are not evaluated as practical energy-saving opportunities. To estimate the energy savings potential from best in class products, we used a similar methodology to that reported in TIAX (2008). That is, for DTVs of similar size, technology, and resolutions, more efficient models draw approximately 25% less power in active mode than the average. Given that active mode accounts for the bulk of the energy consumption, and given that we don’t have a detailed breakdown of the installed DTV technologies, we estimate that the overall energy savings potential is approximately 25%. 5-101 5.19.3 References TIAX, 2008, “Residential Miscellaneous Electric Loads: Energy Consumption Characterization and Savings Potential in 2006 and Scenario-based Projections for 2020,” Final Report by TIAX LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy, Building Technologies Program, April.

Additionally, data on installed base of non-refrigerated units is very sparse 5.20.1 General Discussion Vending machines are used in a wide variety of commercial building types. The quantity per building is generally based on the occupancy rather than the square footage. That is, the greater the number of people in the space, the more vending machines will be present. In addition, vending machines are targeted towards both employees and customers/clients, so the actual number of users can vary significantly depending on the building type. There are approximately 6.7 million vending machines in the United States, of which only 35% are refrigerated. These two million refrigerated units however, account for 74% of the AEC of the vending machines in the United States. While there are numerous types of refrigerated vending machines, the standard cold beverage vending machines can typically hold anywhere from 300 to 800 cans of soda, but are capable of holding both cans and bottles of various sizes. LBNL estimates that in 2008, 77,000 of this type of cold beverage vending machine were shipped; 31% of these units were Energy Star qualified (BEDB, 2008). 5-102 The refrigerated, closed-front unit is a very common type of cold beverage vending machine. By nature of having a fully enclosed and insulated refrigeration compartment, these can be used both indoors and out. When used in a hot outdoor environment, the energy consumption will be higher than average due to a higher duty cycle on the refrigeration system. The refrigerated glass-front units are typically used indoors due to a decreased level of insulation as compared to closed-front units. Currently there are no Energy Star qualifying glass-front units for outdoor use. As shown in Figure 33, almost 30% of education buildings have vending machines. While this is a very significant percentage, the fact that education buildings are only 8.3% (EIA, 2006), of all commercial buildings means that the overall annual load is small in educational buildings. Commercial Buildings (by type) with Refrigerated Vending Machines 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% Office Retail and Service Education Public AOR Percentage of Buildings 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Number of Buildings (000s) Percentage Quantity *Retail excludes both strip and enclosed malls Figure 33: Lodging facilities, such as hotels, motels, and dorm rooms, are much more likely than other building types to have vending machines. Source: EIA 2006 5.20.2 Energy Savings Discussion Energy Star ratings are currently in their second revision (Tier II), and are calculated for new and rebuilt units with the formula (Energy Star Vending, 2009): DailyEnergyConsumption(KWh / day) = 0.45 *[8.66 + (0.009 *C)] where C is the ‘vendible capacity’ or the equivalent capacity of 12 oz soda cans. By these standards, a typical 600 oz capacity vending machine may not consume more than 6.33 kWh/day. In addition, the criteria include a specification for a low power mode in which 5-103 the lighting and refrigeration can be reduced to lower levels after an extended period of inactivity. This specification is based on additional reductions beyond the Canadian energy savings specification listed under CAN/CSA C804-96. A study of the sixteen (16) vending machines on the NREL campus (Deru, 2003) provided comprehensive insight into the savings potential for cold beverage vending machines. The study assessed two main methods for decreases energy consumption: (1) removing the advertising lights, or de-lamping, and (2) using a load manager. In combination, these two approaches reduced energy consumption by 56% without creating any greater temperature fluctuations than existed in the baseline test unit. The lighting in cold beverage machines in merely for aesthetic reasons to help catch people’s eyes as they walk by and to generally promote sales. De-lamping can either be done by the manufacturer by excluding the necessary parts or as a retrofit by a machine owner by simply removing the bulbs. On average, Deru estimated that de-lamping would reduce energy consumption by 29% (Deru, 2003). Using a Load Manager (LM) allows the device to be shut off during periods of inactivity. The LM used in the NREL vending machines used passive IR to turn off the unit when the area was unoccupied. Deru notes that varying results have been published on testing of LMs due to location of the vending unit; if the unit is in a large room that is commonly occupied, there is minimal savings because the sensor will indicate that the unit should continue to run at approximately normal conditions. An additional benefit of using a LM, was that it reduced cycling of the compressor and other components and thereby increased the life of the unit. On average, the savings for the NREL units was found to be 33% (Deru, 2003). Various load managers claim potential savings of upwards of 40% on refrigerated vending machines, and upwards of 50% on non-refrigerated machines (Miser, 2009). For the purposes of this study, a ‘Best in Class’ refrigerated unit will have a 33% lower UEC than the baseline, and a non-refrigerated unit will have a 50% lower UEC than the baseline. 5.20.3 References BEDB, 2008, “Buildings Energy Data Book, 2008,” DOE/EERE, March 2009.

Generally the number and usage of elevators in a building increases with the number of floors in a building. Major retrofits occur on approximately a 20 to 30 year cycle. Elevators consume about 80% of the total vertical transport energy. Elevators can be divided into three basic categories: hydraulic, geared traction, and gearless traction. 80% of elevators are found in buildings with two to seven floors, mainly because there are many more buildings with seven or less floors than more than there are with seven floors. These elevators are typically hydraulically driven. Fifteen percent of elevators are found in buildings with 8 to 24 floors and are generally geared traction elevators. The remaining 5% of elevators are in buildings with 25 or more floors and are typically gearless traction. Figure 34 and Figure 35 provide further detail. 5-105 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 Low-rise (2-6 floors) Mid-rise (7-24 floors) High-rise (25+ floors) Number (1000s) # of buildings w/ elevators # of elevators Figure 34: Allocation of elevators in buildings by number of floors 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 Low-rise (2-6 floors) Mid-rise (7-24 floors) High-rise (25+ floors) AEC (TWh/yr) Other Health Care Education Lodging Office Figure 35: Breakdown of building size by building type There are approximately 35,000 escalators in the U.S. (EIA 2006, Elevator world 2001) and about 40% of them are found in office buildings. Because there are significantly more elevators than escalators, the escalator energy only has an appreciable impact on office building vertical transport energy. There is a wide range of escalator rises, but Enermodal (2004) estimates that about 90% of escalators in Canada are in the range of 10-15 ft. Escalator drive systems (namely, mo- 5-106 tors) are the major energy consuming component, and the energy consumption generally increases with the operating time and the amount of foot traffic. 5.21.2 Energy Savings Discussion Both geared and gearless traction elevators have regeneration (energy recovery) capability, meaning they are able to recover energy during down trips for reuse during up trips. However, only a small number of elevators actually use regeneration. Hydraulic elevators, generally found in smaller buildings, have no regeneration capability and require round-the-clock hydraulic fluid heating. Additional energy is required to power the elevator lights and ventilation fans, and there is generally not an automatic power down during periods of inactivity. Using simple occupancy sensing, various power management schemes could be implemented. Energy efficient elevators in general consume about 30% less energy than typical elevators (Enermodal 2004). The main barrier to the adoption of energy efficient elevators is initial cost and longer than desirable payback periods. Energy efficient escalators can have more efficient gear systems that improve the mechanical efficiency of the drive system. Load-management systems are also offered that cut back the electric motor power during periods of light loads. If there are times when escalators are operating without any passengers, the most energy efficient approach would be to implement a standby mode (initiated by occupancy sensors and timers) that stops the motor during these periods. Manufacturers of energy efficient escalators claim energy savings of 30-50% (Enermodal 2004). 5.21.3 References Elevator World, 2001, “United States - Statistic Year 2000,” Elevator World, October.

Due to varying wastewater regulations, pollutant levels and discharge locations, the level and subsequently the type of treatment also varies. The more advanced treatment requires additional energy. To determine the electricity used for wastewater treatment, it is necessary to determine the volumes of water undergoing each type of treatment. Figure 36 shows the breakdown of total design capacity by level of wastewater treatment. Figure 36: Breakdown of Design Capacity by Level of Treatment (EPRI, 2002) As Figure 36 shows, most wastewater undergoes secondary or greater than secondary treatment. To determine the composite UEC (1388 kWh/million gal), the following assumptions were made, consistent with the EPRI report: • For less than secondary treatment, a value of 50% of activated sludge treatment was used (661 kWh/million gal) 5-108 • For secondary treatment, weighted value of 70% activated sludge and 30% trickling filter was used (1212 kWh/million gal) • For greater than secondary treatment, a weighted values of 50% with and 50% without nitrification was used (1726 kWh/million gal) • For plants with no discharge, an assumption of 400 kWh/million gal was used (EPRI, 2002) Private commercial and industrial wastewater treatment plants have much higher UEC than the public systems. This is due to the fact that private wastewater treatment plants are smaller size, therefore not taking advantage of the economy of scale, and they are usually designed to remove concentrations of specific compounds related to the industrial or commercial operation. These facilities could be pulp and paper mills, food processing plants, metal manufacturing (heavy metals) facilities or chemical manufacturing facilities. These facilities have small volumes and high concentrations (versus public systems with large volumes and low concentrations) which lead to higher UECs. In addition, many private systems discharge to surface water which requires more treatments as this water typically gets reintroduced to the drinking/potable water system. This will most likely lead to increased regulation and treatment in the future. 5.22.2 Energy Savings Discussion The technologies and systems associated with wastewater treatment are mature. The drivers, pumps, and water processing units have been used for many years and there are not any fundamentally new ways to pump and treat water. The only ways to achieve any energy saving would be through the two following means: • Economies of Scale • Replacement of older equipment The achievable benefits with economies of scale for wastewater treatment plants can be between 47 – 63% depending on the type of wastewater treatment with an increase in plant size from 1 MGD to 100 MGD. (EPRI, 2002). The problem is the condensing treatment plants to this scale would require an immense amount of new infrastructure and increased energy for pumping, which may not allow for a positive cost-benefit analysis. The benefits from replacement of older mechanical equipment at a currently operating wastewater treatment plant are minimal. TIAX estimates only a 5% increase in efficiency by replacing pumps and other mechanical equipment. Additionally, there could be savings achieved with restrictions on water usage. These savings would most likely be realized in the AEC, but would coincide with increases in the UEC. At the same time efficiencies can be achieved for wastewater treatment, other factors are increasing UEC (EPRI, 2002): • Age of the water delivery system • Requirements for improved treatment 5-109 As wastewater treatment systems age, there is increased friction in the piping system at the facility and wear on the pumps and other operating equipment. Although there are electricity savings that can be gathered by replacing the entire piping of the system, this can be extremely expensive and not cost effective when compared to the electricity energy savings. Requirements for improved treatment are likely to have the biggest impact on the future increase in water supply and purification UEC. As with drinking water, there are increased amounts of chemicals from pharmaceuticals entering the wastewater system that will need to be removed. 5.22.3 References AP, 2008, Donn, Jeff and Martha Mendoza and Justin Pritchard, “Pharmaceuticals found in drinking water, affecting wildlife and maybe humans,” Associate Press Writers, March 2008, http://hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/pharmawater_site/ day1_01.html.

This is due to the differences in pumping distance and the necessary amount of water treatment. Public supply can be used within the following sectors: domestic, commercial, industrial and thermo-electric power. The breakdown of the public supply for the above sectors is shown in Figure 37 below, including the water for public use and losses. Figure 37: Breakdown of End-Use for Public Water Supply (Solley, 1998) As Figure 37 shows, a minimal amount of public supply water is used for thermo-electric power. Most of the water for thermo-electric power is supplied onsite. The determination of the electricity necessary for private supply of thermo-electric power was not included in this report as the electricity used for the pumping is produced onsite and not from the grid. Public supply comes from both ground and surface water and may need to be pumped and transported a significant distance, such as in California, Arizona, and NYC before being treated and entering the supply system. The surface water UEC for the public system is so high because the surface water is usually transported long distances to the storage and treatment locations. For example, a portion of the surface runoff from the Sierra Nevada Mountain range in Northern California, through the State Water Project, travels 600 miles to Southern California, distributing water to 23 million residents along the way. It takes an estimated 9,200 kWh to pump one million gallons of water (3,000 kWh/acre-foot) through the State Water Project to Southern California (NRDC, 2004). Private supply usually comes from more local ground or surface water sources and can require less treatment as some is used in manufacturing processes and does not need to 5-111 meet the same requirements and regulations as the public supply. For private supply of water, ground water sources require more electricity than surface sources due to the need to pump the water out of the ground. 5.23.2 Energy Savings Discussion The technologies and systems associated with water supply and treatment are mature. The drivers, pumps and water processing units have been used for many years and there are not any fundamentally new ways to pump and treat water. The only ways to achieve any energy saving would be through the two following means: • Economies of Scale • Replacement of older equipment Although there are achievable benefits with economies of scale, only an estimated 5% reduction can be achieved through an increase in plant size from 1 MGD to 10 MGD. (EPRI, 2002). Also, the benefits from replacement of older mechanical equipment are minimal. TIAX estimates only a 5% increase in efficiency by replacing pumps and other mechanical equipment. Additionally, there could be savings achieved with restrictions on water usage. These savings would most likely be realized in the AEC, but would coincide with increases in the UEC. At the same time efficiencies can be achieved for water supply and treatment, other factors are increasing UEC (EPRI, 2002): • Age of the water delivery system • Requirements for improved treatment As water treatment systems age, there is increased friction in the piping system requiring additional electricity. Although there are electricity savings that can be gathered by replacing the entire piping of the system, this can be extremely expensive and not cost effective when compared to the electricity energy savings. Requirements for improved treatment are likely to have the biggest impact on the future increase in water supply and purification UEC. With studies showing the significant quantities of pharmaceutical drugs (including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones) being found, although in very small concentrations, in drinking water across the country, one can conclude that increased regulatory standards for water treatment and purification will come in the future (AP, 2008). 5.23.3 References AP, 2008, Donn, Jeff and Martha Mendoza and Justin Pritchard, “Pharmaceuticals found in drinking water, affecting wildlife and maybe humans,” Associate Press Writers, March 2008, http://hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/pharmawater_site/ day1_01.html.

Cooking equipment is primarily located in cafeterias, lounge and kitchen areas. Unit Energy Consumption The UEC and best in class UEC are calculated based on a weighted average value of each cooking equipment type. Summarized in the table below, ADL (1993) estimates the quantity of cooking equipment per building and the average power consumption for each equipment type. The best in class UEC for each equipment type is based on the highest energy reduction percentage provided by ADL (1993) when certain energy saving technologies (see Section 5.3) are applied to a particular piece of equipment.

The installed base is calculated from the number of units in each building type from by ADL (1993) and the number of buildings of that type from EIA (2006). In the case of office buildings, ADL (1993) has indicated that there is a substantial amount of all types of cooking equipment. TIAX has adjusted the number of units per building to better suit the current number and diversity of office buildings than when the ADL (1993) report was originally written. The total AEC is a sum of the AECs of each cooking equipment type in office buildings.

Capacity varies significantly while avg load remains relatively consistent according to Cadmus Group (1999). Best in Class 20% savings from typical unit (1,300 kWh/yr UEC) Office Building Energy Savings Potential 0.4 TWh/yr Office Building Trends and Notes Typical dry-type distribution transformers are found in commercial buildings which are less efficient than liquid-immersed type. Unit Energy Consumption The UEC is calculated by dividing the AEC by the installed base. We assume that a "typical" distribution transformer in commercial building to be constantly on and have a capacity of 75kVA, which is the most common among the sampled transformers in Cadmus Group (1999) study. Also to be consistent with Cadmus Group (1999) findings, we assume that the average loads on the transformers were consistent across all building types, varying from only 14.1 to 17.6 percent (~16% on average). Since distribution transformers are primarily found in large commercial buildings, we used the electrical energy going into buildings greater than 50,000 square feet obtained from CBECS to calculate the installed base for each building type using the aforementioned assumptions. Annual Energy Consumption The AEC, which is the energy loss due to transformer inefficiencies, is calculated by taking the total energy used by buildings of greater than 50,000 square feet and applying by a 98.5% efficiency value to obtain the energy loss. Typically, distribution transformer efficiencies are in the range of 97% to 99.5% (LBNL’s Energy Efficiency Standards, 2009). Building types that do not have an abundance of buildings greater than 50,000 square feet were excluded. 6-116 References Cadmus Group, 1999, “Metered Load Factors for Low-Voltage, Dry-Type Transformers in Commercial, Industrial, and Public Buildings,” Report for Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships and Boston Edison Company, December.

Office buildings will continue to see the highest concentration of monitors. 6-117 Unit Energy Consumption The average power consumption of monitors in this report is based on TIAX (2007) data and was calculated using a weighted average of the four key monitor categories. Each grouping weight is based on installed base and shipment estimates for each monitor type from iSuppli (2005) and power draw values from Roberson et al. (2002) and data from EPA Energy Star (Energy Star 2006). Although the TIAX (2007) data looks at the four monitor categories in residential setting, it is assumed that their installed base ratio is similar in commercial buildings. (See Table 47): Table 47: Monitor Power Draw Values (from TIAX 2007, iSuppli 2005) Power Draw [W] Monitor Size Installed Base [%] Active Sleep Off CRT – 17” 40% 61 2 1 LCD – 15” 15% 20 1 1 LCD – 17” 35% 31 1 1 LCD – 19” 10% 35 1 1 Average 100% 42 1 1 As seen in the above table, CRTs constitute slightly under half of the overall installed base in addition to drawing almost twice as much power as LCDs. The electron gun and electromagnets in CRT monitors are the main hardware components consuming the most power. In LCD monitors, the backlights account for approximately 80% of the active power draw, yet only about one percent of the electricity flowing into the backlights comes out the front of the display, i.e., a system efficiency of around 1% (TIAX, 2004). Approximately 95% of all monitors sold in 2004 met the 2004 Energy Star power requirements for sleep and off mode power draw (TIAX, 2008). Starting in 2005, an active mode power requirement was implemented based on monitor resolution along with sleep and off mode requirements of less than 4 and 2 watts respectively (EPA, 2006.). The current Energy Star criteria for monitors are summarized in the table below: Table 48: Monitors Key Product Criteria (Energy Star, 2009) On Mode Sleep Mode Off Mode Tier 1 Maximum Allowable Power Consumption: Effective January 1, 2005 Y = 38X + 30. Y is expressed in watts and rounded up to the nearest whole number and X is the number of megapixels in decimal form <= 4 watts <= 2 watts Tier 2 Maximum Allowable Power Consumption: Effective January 1, 2006 If X < 1 megapixel, then Y = 23; if X > 1 megapixel, then Y = 28X. Y is expressed in watts and rounded up to the nearest whole number and X is the number of megapixels in decimal form <= 2 watts <= 1 watt 6-118 In this report, TIAX infers monitor usage patterns in three key building types (offices, education and healthcare) based on the LBNL (2007) study where sixteen buildings in three cities were surveyed. Table 39 and Table 49 summarize the density of all the office equipment (which includes monitors) and remaining miscellaneous equipment in the various sampled buildings (including the power states of all the monitors during after-hours).

Using the EIA (2006) data of the total square feet of each of the aforementioned three building types, the installed base of monitors was calculated based on the LBNL (2007) monitor density data.

They are PC-centric and are most common in office settings and in close proximity to PCs. Since around 74% of the US population of computers were found among office, education and healthcare buildings (LBNL, 2007), it follows that the same percentage of office equipment is found in the aforementioned types of buildings as well. TIAX estimates of office equipment usage patterns as well as their installed base in the context of various commercial building types were deduced from the LBNL (2007) study. For this study, LBNL conducted an after-hours power status survey of over 500 office equipment units in sixteen commercial buildings in three cities. Table 52 and Table 53summarize the equipment densities in each sampled building and the after-hours power states of the various loads: 6-121 Table 52: Office Equipment: Number of Units and Density (LBNL, 2007) Table 53: Office Equipment: After-Hours Power States (LBNL, 2007) For this study, TIAX assumed an average power consumption of servers of approximately 250W as per Koomey (2007), and assumed that the servers are constantly on throughout the day, which accounts for their relatively large energy consumption. The server installed 6-122 base was inferred from server density data in a sample of 12 commercial buildings surveyed by LBNL (2004).

The average power consumptions among the various modes of operation were based on TIAX (2008) as seen in the above table. Estimating the PC installed base in the various building types as well as the PC usage patterns during non-business hours are the two main areas of potential data uncertainty. Much of the estimates are based on LBNL (2004) data which surveyed 12 buildings in three states and has an accurate breakdown of PC usage pattern based on building types. Values from LBNL (2004) and from CBECS (2003) are used to project values up to 2008 as well as to obtain PC energy consumption values in building types that were not surveyed in LBNL (2004). LBNL (2004) recorded the number of computers in each buildings as well as the power state during after-hours.

TIAX estimates that the average installed full size unit uses 660 kWh/yr. This takes into account the current average UEC for 2009 model year units, as well as the fact that the average life is approximately 15 years. New units consume as little as 300 kWh/yr or less, while the older models still in use can consume up to four times that much. 6-126 The preliminary estimate came from the 2009 Buildings Energy Data Book (EERE, 2009). Further analysis confirmed the data. Using the CBECS installed base for all commercial buildings (7,148,595) and an annual sales growth rate equal to the commercial building growth rate (0.75% - calculated from growth between 1995 and 2003 in CBECS), TIAX calculated the sales over the past 15 years (average life span). Weighting the average energy consumption by model year from the Canadian Office of Energy Efficiency (COEE) with these calculated sales numbers resulted in a UEC of installed full size units of 660 kWh/yr (Lindia, 2007). This number confirmed the preliminary estimate. The Residential Energy Consumption Study (RECS, 2001) listed an average UEC of 1239 kWh/yr for full size units. This value is believed to be markedly higher due to the fact that many years have passed since this information was collected. According to the COEE, in 2001 the average residential refrigerator-freezer on the market consumed approximately 600 kWh/yr. Beginning soon after that time, significant improvements were made that resulted in units that consumed 400 to 450 kWh/yr starting in 2004 (Lindia, 2007). Alternatively, the Energy Star calculations list an average UEC of 560 kWh/yr using a 13 year average life span (ES calculations - Residential, 2009). An LBNL study in 2007 lists the UEC as 567 kWh/yr (LBNL, 2007). These numbers are lower than the TIAX estimate mainly due to the shorter life span which means that fewer of the older and less efficient units were included in the average. The life span of 15 years was calculated using the various life estimates from Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. The estimates for various types were weighted using the market share estimates from the COEE. Compact units were broken out as a separate value given how different they are in terms of energy consumption. TIAX estimates that for compact refrigerators and refrigeratorfreezers (defined as having less than 7.75 cu ft capacity and being shorter than 36” by Energy Star), the UEC is 325 kWh/yr. This is the average of the values found by the COEE for the model years between 2000 and 2005. In this case it is not a weighted average because unlike full size units, the performance has stayed relatively consistent over the last 10 years. Annual Energy Consumption TIAX estimates that the AEC of residential refrigeration in office buildings is 2.8 TWh/yr. This is based on a combination of full size units and compact units; the installed base is 1.2 million units (EIA, 2006) for full size, consuming 0.8 TWh/yr, and 6.4 million for compact units, consuming 2.0 TWh/yr. 6.1.6.2 Refrigeration – Commercial Units Table 61: Detailed findings for Commercial Refrigeration in Office Buildings Comments/Values AEC (TWh/yr) 0.3 6-127 Comments/Values Installed Base 74,000 (EIA, 2006) Units per 100,000 ft2 0.6 UEC (kWh/yr) 3,900 (weighted average of coolers and freezers) UEC Variability Significantly larger size range than residential units. Large units can contain 6+ doors and have UEC that is dramatically higher than avg. Best in Class 62% savings from typical unit (2400 kWh/yr) Office Energy Savings Potential 0.2 TWh/yr Office Trends and Notes Very few assumed to be in office space – majority are for food industry located in office buildings. Unit Energy Consumption TIAX estimates that the UEC of commercial refrigeration units is 3,900 kWh/yr. This is based on a 60/40 split between refrigerators and freezers (CEE, 2007) and Energy Star “Conventional Unit” estimates for UEC of “conventional freezers” of 4519 kWh/yr (ES Commercial Freezer calculations, 2009) and “conventional refrigerators” of 3548 kWh/yr (ES Commercial Refrigerator calculations, 2009). Energy Star’s “Conventional Freezer” is 24 cu ft while the “Conventional refrigerator” is 44 cu ft. Estimates from other sources that were on the low side included the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, which estimated a UEC of 3200 kWh/yr (ACEEE, 2004). As with Energy Star, this is presumed to be a 48 cu ft, two-door unit. This estimate does not include freezer units, and likely is not an estimate of the average installed unit, thereby consuming much closer to what a new unit on the market today would consume. Other published estimates run higher; using the same 60/40 refrigerator/freezer split used in TIAX calculations, an ADL study from 1996 estimates as high as 5040 kWh/yr. An LBNL study in 2007 continued to use these numbers despite being 11 years old at the time (LBNL, 2007). This is significantly higher than the TIAX estimate since it is out of date, and efficiencies have improved dramatically in that time. The ADL estimated market breakdown of units is assumed to still be accurate. The percentages are shown below in Table 62 (ADL, 1996). Table 62: Percentage of commercial units that are refrigerators and freezers, listed by size Size % of Refrigerators % of Freezers One door 50% 55% Two doors 45% 40% Three or more doors 5% 5% 6-128 Annual Energy Consumption The 74,000 units (EIA, 2006) in office buildings in the US consume 0.3 TWh/yr. Since offices generally do not need this type of refrigeration, TIAX assumes that they are used instead in restaurants or other food related businesses and laboratories in buildings that are greater than 50% office space.

Products generally have long lifetimes and are selected based on first cost. Unit Energy Consumption The UEC for elevators is based on the breakdown of low-, medium-, and high-rise buildings for the particular building type, an assumed elevator type, average energy consumption per elevator start, and number of elevator starts per year. For office buildings, the UEC was calculated to be 5800 kWh/yr, as shown in Table 64.

(Al-Sharif 1997) The model was developed from actual measurements of in situ escalator rise, usage, and energy consumption. The model outputs energy as a function of escalator rise and operating time. The average escalator rise is based on a distribution of rises for a sample of in situ escalators. (Enermodal 2004) TIAX estimates the average usage to be approximately twelve hours per day. It is also assumed that there is an equal number of up and down escalators installed in buildings. 6-130 Annual Energy Consumption In office buildings, there are 240,000 elevators and 14,000 escalators installed, which consume 1.4 and 0.3 TWh/yr, respectively.

Best in Class 80% Savings from typical unit (610 kWh/yr UEC ) Retail & Service Energy Savings Potential 0.4 TWh/yr Retail and Service Trends and Notes The majority of units are stand alone Unit Energy Consumption As the installed base has grown, so has the energy consumption. The growth has generally been in line with that of other electronics, such as monitors, PCs, etc, which are all included in each ATM. In 1993, ADL estimated that in active mode (currently servicing a customer), an ATM consumed 350 Watts, and in stand-by mode, an ATM consumed 300 Watts. Combined with ADL’s estimates of time in each mode (790 hrs/yr in active and 7880 in stand-by), the annual UEC was 2600 kWh/yr (ADL, 1993). In 2002, however, Roth estimated a new UEC of 3600 kWh/yr for a full service unit and 1900 kWh/yr for a cash dispenser (Roth, 2002). These numbers are based on averages of active and idle mode measurements on a few machines. The power consumption for each mode is detailed below in Table 66. Based on this data, TIAX assumed a weighted average UEC of 3000 kWh/yr. Table 66: The power consumption for the two types of ATM based on mode (Roth, 2002) Power Use Annual Usage Active Stand-by Active Stand-by % of Units UEC Watts Watts Hrs/yr Hrs/yr % kWh/yr Full Service 471 379 63 3600 Cash Dispenser 250 200 1240 7880 37 1900 Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across all retail and service buildings. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the installed base multiplied by the UEC. The 150,000 ATMs in retail and service buildings consume 0.6 TWh/yr of electricity (Kerber, 2008). 6-133 To obtain the installed base for this calculation, TIAX performed an informal review of typical retail and service buildings and estimates ATM installations to be at a rate of 1 per 100,000 sq ft of space.

Summarized in the table below, ADL (1993) estimates the number of cooking units per building and the average power consumption for each equipment type. The best in class UEC for each equipment type is based on the highest energy reduction percentage provided by ADL (1993) when certain energy saving technologies (see Section 5.3) are applied to a particular cooking equipment type. 6-134 Table 68: Overview of Cooking Equipment average power consumption and usage in Retail & Services buildings Equipment Type AEC (TWh/yr) Installed Base (1000s) UEC (kWh/yr) Best in Class UEC (%) Building Energy Savings Potential (TWh/yr) Broilers 0.5 18 29,000 14 0.09 Fryers 0.6 86 7,300 10 0.06 Griddles 1.1 100 11,000 10 0.11 Ovens 1.9 92 20,000 13 0.30 Ranges 0.3 19 14,000 10 0.02 Steamers 1.5 140 11,000 15 0.20 Annual Energy Consumption The AEC for each cooking equipment type in retail and service buildings is calculated by multiplying its respective UEC with its installed base. The installed base is calculated from the number of units in each building type from ADL (1993) and the number of buildings of that type from EIA (2006). In the case of retail and service buildings, ADL (1993) has indicated that there is a substantial amount of all types of cooking equipment. TIAX has adjusted the number of units per building in this building type to better suit the current number and diversity of retail and services buildings than when the ADL (1993) report was originally written. The total AEC is a sum of the AECs of each cooking equipment type in retail and services buildings.

Service buildings with significant laundry equipment energy consumption include buildings for laundry route operations and coin operations (a.k.a., Laundromats). As mentioned in Section 5.9, the energy consumption evaluated in this study is the electric energy consumed by laundry equipment motors and controls. Most of the energy associated with laundry goes towards heating the water used for laundry and to heat gas fired dryers. Neither water heating energy, nor gas consumption are accounted for in this assessment. Energy Star suggests that the average energy consumption for residential-style commercial washers, like those used in coin operation facilities, is 0.15 kWh/load for Energy Star 6-136 units and 0.21 kWh/load for conventional units. The Energy Star calculator also appears to account for dryer energy, but it is unclear if the electric energy for tumbling and controls in gas dryers is included, since the stated energy for washing with no drying is equal to the energy for washing with gas drying. (EPA 2009) ADL (1993) estimates the washer electric energy to be 0.013 kWh/lb for a 10.7 lb load, and PNNL (2008) estimates 0.023 kWh/lb for larger 75 lb washers, both exclusive of dryer energy. For this study, 0.2 kWh/load was taken as a representative baseline for washer energy. This gives an average UEC of 190 kWh/yr, assuming 950 loads per year for an average commercial washer. (EPA 2009) The UEC will vary depending on usage and load capacity. Also, horizontalaxis (i.e., front load) washers generally consume less electric energy than vertical (i.e., top load) washers. It is assumed that commercial dryers are generally gas fired. As indicated above, the Energy Star calculator does not seem to account for the electric energy consumed by gas dryers (i.e., the energy consumed by the tumble motor and controls). ADL (1993) estimated that the electric energy consumption of a commercial gas dryer was 0.33 kWh/load, or 0.028 kWh/lb. This is a somewhat outdated estimate, and generally newer appliances have become more efficient than older versions. Newer dryers likely consume less electric energy because washers are more effective at removing water during the final spin cycle. PNNL (2008) states that large 60 lb capacity gas dryers consume 0.01 kWh/lb. This estimate is likely more in line with the current installed base, yielding an average electric UEC of approximately 90kWh/yr, based on approximately 10,000 lbs per year per dryer. The energy consumption of dry cleaning equipment was calculated based on the estimated weight of clothes dry cleaned annually, 2.4 billion pounds, and the estimated electric energy consumption per pound of clothes, 0.12 kWh/lb (ADL 1993). There are approximately 50,000 dry cleaning facilities in the U.S. Annual Energy Consumption TIAX estimated the installed base of commercial washers and dryers by scaling the estimates from ADL (1993) based on population. This method yields 1.8 million washers and two million dryers. The annual energy consumption for washers, dryers, and dry cleaners was 0.3 TWh, 0.2 TWh, and 0.3 TWh, respectively. Federal standards were initiated for residential-style commercial washer energy and water usage in 2007. The modified energy factor (MEF) sets the amount of energy that can be consumed for the sum of water heating energy, operation energy, and post wash drying energy per load capacity. Additionally, a water factor (WF) sets the maximum amount of water that can be consumed during a wash per load capacity. Tax incentives such as EPACT 2005 have also helped to promote the penetration of more efficient wash equipment. Generally, the electric energy consumption of laundry equipment is reduced by reducing wash agitator energy or by reducing dryer time. The Energy Star commercial washer energy calculator indicates that efficient commercial equipment (with a gas dryer) consumes about 25% less electric energy than conventional equipment. 6-137 References ADL, 1993, “Characterization of Commercial Building Appliances,” Final Report to the Building Equipment Division Office of Building Technologies, U.S. Department of Energy, June.

The UEC for each type is sourced from a 1996 report by ADL (ADL, 1996). While this is not as recent as some other industry data, other institutions, including the Canadian Office of Energy Efficiency (COEE Walkin, 2009), still cite this information as an accurate representation of the market. Data for typical units are shown below in Table 75. While combination units provide economies of scale, the total UEC is still significantly higher than a typical freezer or cooler simply due to the inherent size. Table 75: Typical walk-in refrigeration unit specifications (ADL, 1996) Unit configuration Size m2 (ft2 ) UEC kWh/yr Cooler 15 (161) 16,200 Freezer 15 (161) 21,400 Combination Freezer-Cooler 31 (334) 30,200 The weighting for calculating the UEC comes from ADL’s estimated installed base in 1996. ADL lists 540,000 walk-in coolers, 275,000 walk-in freezers, and 65,000 walk-in combination units (for a total of 880,000 units). Annual Energy Consumption AEC data are from the 2003 CBECS survey which gives a total of 1.3 million units in the United States in 2003 (EIA, 2006). This value includes a TIAX estimate of 80,000 units in mall buildings (enclosed and strip-type malls) which are excluded from CBECS data. While TIAX believes this to be a high total estimate for 2003 based on the ADL 1996 numbers, it seems very reasonable as an estimate for an updated installed base for this study. For the 13 year period between 1995 and 2008, the increase in installed base of 420,000 units corresponds to a 3% compound annual growth rate. This rate approximates the average annual GDP growth over the time period (~3.1%), and is therefore believed to be a reasonable assumption. 6.2.7.2 Refrigeration – Commercial Units Table 76: Detailed findings for Commercial Refrigeration in Retail and Service Buildings Comments/Values AEC (TWh/yr) 1.4 6-140 Comments/Values Installed Base 360,000 (CBECS) Units per 100,000 Sq Ft 2.4 UEC (kWh/yr) 3,900 (weighted average of coolers and freezers) UEC Variability Significantly larger size range than residential units.

In non-food retail and service buildings, there is very little data regarding the installed base, power draw, or usage of televisions. TIAX has estimated that installed TVs are generally digital TVs (DTVs), and the average UEC was calculated by estimating the UEC of TVs in two key applications. First, DTVs on display in big box electronics retail buildings are estimated to consume 1,550 kWh/yr, the equivalent of an average 50 inch, 350 W DTV on for 12 hours per day. Second, TIAX estimates that half of all other non-food retail and service buildings have a 30 inch, 125 W television that is operated for approximately 8 hours per day, which corresponds to a UEC of 390 kWh/yr. Installed televisions are estimated to consume 4 W in off mode, but this assumption has little impact on the UEC estimates. TIAX estimates that there are approximately 10,000 big box electronics stores in the U. S., with approximately 300,000 displays. With an estimated 600,000 TVs in other retail and service buildings, the weighted averaged TV UEC was calculated to be 780 kWh/yr. Because of the lack of data, there is a relatively high degree of uncertainty in this estimate. Annual Energy Consumption Even with fairly aggressive UEC estimates, the overall TV AEC for non-food retail and service buildings is only 0.7 TWh/yr, and therefore the uncertainty associated with the estimate will not have a large impact on the overall study results. However, in large consumer electronics retail buildings, display DTVs may consume a considerable portion of the overall building energy consumption. Therefore, it may be useful to understand the TV energy consumption more accurately in buildings with a high concentration of large DTVs that are on for a significant fraction of the time.

Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across all retail and service buildings. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the sum of the installed base multiplied by the UEC for each vending machine type. The 1.7 million vending machines in retail and service buildings (EIA, 2006) consume 2.9 TWh/yr of electricity. The installed base used in these calculations for refrigerated units is the CBECS estimate from 2003 (EIA, 2006). While broadly defined as “vending machines” in the refrigeration section of the CBECS data, it is assumed that users would respond to the survey with the number of refrigerated units due to the structure and nature of the questions (EIA, 2006). Because CBECS does not explicitly categorize non-refrigerated units, estimates for installed base were calculated as a growth adjusted estimate from ADL (ADL, 1991). For consistency sake, the percentage of total units in each category was maintained across refrigerated and non-refrigerated units. (The units/building however was not maintained such that the total installed base in the US could grow appropriately.) 6-143 References ADL, 1991, “Characterization of Commercial Building End-Uses Other Than HVAC and Lighting,” Arthur D.

The 150,000 ATMs in food sales buildings consume 0.5 TWh/yr of electricity (Kerber, 2008). To obtain the installed base for this calculation, TIAX used data from 2003 CBECS and assumed that 100% of supermarkets (86,000) have one unit, 50% of convenience stores have one unit (72,000) and 50% of convenience stores with gas (57,000) have one unit (EIA, 2006).

Best in Class 24% Savings from typical unit (6200 kWh/yr) Food Sales Energy Savings Potential 0.1 TWh/yr Food Sales Trends and Notes Uses include Meat/Seafood counter coolers, soft-drink dispensers, and for direct sale (by the bag). 6-148 Unit Energy Consumption The UEC for ice machines is calculated based on daily usage parameters and therefore varies by building type. For food sales buildings, TIAX believes that daily usage is greater than the ‘typical’ or ‘default’ case. The usage variables that TIAX addresses include: duty cycle (%), energy consumption (kWh/100 lbs ice), and ice production (lbs per 24 hrs). The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) under the DOE/EERE provides default values for usage as 500 lbs ice per 24 hrs for 3000 hours per year (34% duty cycle) with energy consumption of 5.5 kWh per 100 lbs of ice (FEMP, 2009). Many discrepancies exist in duty cycle estimates, for example, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council assumes typical usage is approximately 4400 hours per year or a 50% duty cycle. In addition to the FEMP data, they cite the ADL 1996 study, which uses a 50% duty cycle (ADL 1996), and the Food Service Technology Center (FTSC) which uses a duty cycle of 75% (Fish-Nick, 2007) as a basis for choosing the 50% value. TIAX estimates that a 45% duty cycle is accurate based on these sources; this value is used for calculations in all building types. In assessing energy consumption, TIAX reviewed all currently certified (AHRI) units. While consumption can vary significantly from one unit to another, above ~280 lbs/day (80% of certified units), energy consumption per 100 lbs of ice remains relatively flat versus unit capacity; the vast majority of units average approximately 5.2 kWh/100 lbs. TIAX estimates that for food sales buildings, an accurate average daily capacity is 950 lbs. Using the variables that are summarized in Table 84, this means an annual UEC of 8,100 kWh/yr Table 84: TIAX usage assumptions for Ice Machines in Food Sales Buildings Usage Variable Units Value Annual Duty Cycle % 45 Daily Harvest Lbs 950 Energy Consumption kWh/100 lbs 5.2 Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across all food sales buildings. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the installed base multiplied by the UEC. The 58,000 ice machines in food sales buildings consume 0.5 TWh/yr of electricity. To obtain the installed base for this calculation, TIAX assumed that the percentage of ice machines in each building type has not changed since the ADL estimates in 1991 (ADL, 1991). To update the value over the 18 years that have passed since that data was gathered, TIAX used a compound annual growth rate of 0.75%, which is an approximation of the growth rate of the number of commercial buildings in the same time period. 6-149 References ADL, 1991, “Characterization of Commercial Building End-Uses Other Than HVAC and Lighting,” Arthur D.

The larger stores (> 5000 sq ft) tend to have nearly all of their refrigeration run from a central system, with coolant pipes running throughout the building to heat exchangers in each open or closed case. These buildings are estimated to use 48% (Kauffeld, 2007) to 52% (EIA, 2006) of their electricity for refrigeration. TIAX estimates that 90% of the refrigeration electric load in these buildings is from the central system. The remaining 10% is for walk-in units that are in the back for short term inventory storage and for standalone cases such as beverage merchandisers, deli counter refrigerators, and other selfcontained display cases (e.g. ice cream freezers near the checkout). In smaller food sales buildings, such as small markets and convenience stores, the trend toward central refrigeration is reversed; fewer small food sales stores have central systems for economic reasons. These stores rely on walk-in units for inventory storage and selfcontained units and glass-door merchandiser units for holding goods on the main sales floor. These buildings may consume as much as 75% of the electricity on refrigeration (EIA 2006). 6-151 6.3.7.1 Refrigeration – Central Table 88: Detailed findings for Central Refrigeration in Food Sales Buildings Comments/Values AEC (TWh/yr) 19 Installed Base 28,000 Units per 100,000 Sq Ft NA – generally one unit per building UEC (kWh/yr) 670,000 (some as large as 1,000,000 or more) UEC Variability UEC can range up to 1.25MM kWh/yr/unit or more – proportional to store size Best in Class 46% Savings from typical unit (360,000 kWh/yr) Food Sales Energy Savings Potential 8.6 TWh/yr Food Sales Trends and Notes This is unique to Food Sales buildings; most similar is warehouse refrigeration, which is unique to warehouses. Unit Energy Consumption TIAX estimates that the UEC for a single system is 500,000 kWh/yr. More than other loads, this value varies dramatically since each individual system has different needs in terms of square footage, refrigeration tonnage, etc. Some systems can be 1,000,000 kWh/yr (ADL, 1996) or more, such as those in the 200 grocery stores in the US that have more than 100,000 sq ft of space (EIA 2006). Annual Energy Consumption TIAX estimates that the 27,800 central refrigeration systems in food sales buildings in the United States consume 19 TWh/yr. This is based on the assumption that all grocery stores and markets (as defined by CBECS) over 5000 sq ft have central refrigeration systems, and that 95% of their refrigeration load is from their central system. The remaining 5% is for commercial units (see Section 6.3.7.2) and walk-in units (see Section 6.3.7.3). 6-152 6.3.7.2 Refrigeration – Commercial Units Table 89: Detailed findings for Commercial Refrigeration in Food Sales Buildings Comments/Values AEC (TWh/yr) 2.8 Installed Base 720,000 (CBECS) Units per 100,000 Sq Ft 57 UEC (kWh/yr) 3,900 (weighted average of coolers and freezers) UEC Variability Significantly larger size range than residential units.

Unit Energy Consumption See Section 6.1.6.2 for commercial unit coolers/freezers UEC data as listed under office buildings. Noteworthy however, is the fact that generally more commercial units in food sales buildings have glass doors than in other building types due to the nature of the application. It is common that the only solid-door units in food sales will be those in employee-only areas of the store. Without greater knowledge of usage patterns and observational support data, TIAX must assume that the UEC remains the same across the various building types. Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across all retail and service buildings. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the installed base multiplied by the UEC. The 720,000 commercial unit coolers and freezers in food sales buildings (EIA, 2006) consume 2.8 TWh/yr. 6.3.7.3 Refrigeration – Walk-in Units Table 90: Detailed findings for Walk-in Refrigeration in Food Sales Buildings Comments/Values AEC (TWh/yr) 5.9 Installed Base 310,000 (EIA, 2006) Units per 100,000 Sq Ft 25 UEC (kWh/yr) 19,000 (weighted avg of coolers/freezers/combinations) 6-153 Comments/Values UEC Variability Systems can vary dramatically depending on size and temperature needed Best in Class 62% Savings from typical unit (7,200 kWh/yr UEC ADL, 1996) Food Sales Energy Savings Potential 3.7 TWh/yr Food Sales Trends and Notes Generally used in employee-only areas for short term inventory of nonshelved items.

Table 84 summarizes the usage characteristics for ice machines in both food service and food sales buildings. Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across all food service buildings. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the installed base multiplied by the UEC. The 340,000 ice machines in food service buildings (EIA, 2006) consume 2.6 TWh/yr of electricity. To obtain the installed base for this calculation, TIAX assumed that the percentage of ice machines in each building type has not changed since the ADL estimates in 1991 (ADL, 1991). To update the value over the 18 years that have passed since that data was gathered, TIAX used a compound annual growth rate of 0.75%, which is an approximation of the growth rate of the number of commercial buildings in the same time period.

In food service buildings, there is very little data regarding the installed base, power draw, or usage of televisions. TIAX has estimated that installed TVs are generally digital TVs (DTVs) in restaurants and bars, and the average UEC was calculated to be 940 kWh/yr. This is the UEC corresponding to an average 40 inch flat panel DTV, about 250 W, operating for 8 hours per day. Installed televisions are estimated to consume 4 W in off mode, but this assumption has little impact on the UEC estimates. As with DTVs in other commercial buildings, there is little data to support the UEC calculations, and the estimates are based mainly on anecdotal evidence. Annual Energy Consumption The installed base of TVs in food service buildings was estimated by assuming that there is one TV per 1,000 square feet of floor area in restaurants, excluding fast food restaurants and cafeterias. This results in an installed base of 1.4 million TVs which consume 1.3 TWh/yr. References EIA, 2006, “2003 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey”, DOE/EIA.

For example, cafeterias in high schools are open only during lunch time. Unit Energy Consumption The UEC and best in class UEC are calculated based on weighted averages of each cooking equipment type respectively. Summarized in the table below, ADL (1993) estimates the number of cooking units per building and the average power consumption for each equipment type. The best in class UEC for each equipment type is based on the highest energy reduction percentage provided by ADL (1993) when certain energy saving technologies (see Section 5.3) are applied to a particular cooking equipment type.

The installed base is calculated from the number of units in each building type from ADL (1993) and the number of buildings of that type from CBECS (EIA, 2006). In the case of education buildings, ADL (1993) has indicated that there is a substantial amount of all types of cooking equipment. The total AEC is a sum of the AECs of each cooking equipment type in education buildings.

Unlike food sales Buildings, however, ice machines in education buildings tend to be lower capacity. TIAX assumes that the average daily capacity is approximately 500 lbs. Analysis of various AHRI certified units indicates that, as with the majority of units rated for greater than 280 lbs per day, the energy consumption is relatively flat at a function of unit capacity at 5.2 kWh/100 lbs of ice. Using these assumptions, the UEC is 4300 kWh/yr. Table 104 summarizes the usage characteristics that are used for ice machines in education buildings in this study.

Unit Energy Consumption See Section 6.1.1 for vending machine UEC data, as listed under office buildings. 6-169 Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across all retail and service buildings. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the sum of the installed base multiplied by the UEC for each vending machine type. The 1.7 million vending machines in retail and service buildings (EIA, 2006) consume 2.9 TWh/yr of electricity. The installed base used in these calculations for refrigerated units is the CBECS estimate from 2003 (EIA, 2006). While broadly defined as “vending machines” in the refrigeration section of the CBECS data, it is assumed that users would respond to the survey with the number of refrigerated units due to the structure and nature of the questions (EIA, 2006). Because CBECS does not explicitly categorize non-refrigerated units, estimates for installed base were calculated as a growth adjusted estimate from ADL (ADL, 1991). For consistency sake, the percentage of total units in each category was maintained across refrigerated and non-refrigerated units. (The units/building however was not maintained such that the total installed base in the US could grow appropriately.)

The model outputs energy as a function of escalator rise and operating time. The average escalator rise based on a distribution of rises for a sample of in situ escalators. (Enermodal 2004) TIAX estimates the average usage to be approximately twelve hours per day. It is also assumed that there is an equal number of up and down escalators installed in buildings.

In refrigerated warehouses, the largest load is often the refrigeration system. Other common loads include lighting and transport vehicle such as forklifts. Often small offices are included in warehouses that may include PCs, monitors, fax machines, printers, vending machines and other office equipment. Besides office space, warehouses do not generally have other building activities mixed in such as retail; they are generally stand alone buildings that are located in industrial zoned areas or other more economically favorable sections of cities that have less commercial activity. The largest warehouses can be more than one million square feet in size and if they are refrigerated, they can have annual energy intensities on the order of tens of kWh/sq ft. CBECS found that of the more than 13 Terawatt-hours of electricity used in refrigerated warehouses every year, almost 8 Terawatt-hours are for refrigeration (EIA, 2006). Key MELs for warehouse buildings are shown in Figure 44. The total annual energy consumption for key MELs in warehouse buildings is almost 16 TWh/yr. 180 1,600 19,000 450 4,800 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 0 2 4 6 8 10 Monitors Distribution Transformers Walk‐in Refrigeration PC Non‐Road Vehicles Warehouse Refrigeration Unit Energy Consumption (kWh/yr) Annual Energy Consumption (TWh/yr) WarehouseBuilding Key MELs →UEC=520,000 KeyMEL Total: 15.5 Twh/yr Figure 44: Key MELs for warehouse buildings 6.6.1 Distribution Transformers Table 115: Detailed findings for Distribution Transformers in Warehouse buildings Comments/Values 6-172 Comments/Values AEC (TWh/yr) 0.8 Installed Base (1000s) 490 Units per 100,000ft2 4.9 UEC (kWh/yr) 1600 UEC variability Efficiency primarily affected by rated capacity, average load and temperature.

Refrigerated warehouses are specifically broken out as a building type in the survey, so using 99% of the refrigeration load (~7.9 TWh/yr) and dividing by the total number of buildings (15,000) gives a UEC of approximately 520,000 kWh/yr (EIA, 2006). The other 1% of electricity used for refrigeration in warehouses (~.1TWh/yr) is for various other uses such as compact residential units in small offices that may be part of the building. CBECS found that 1048 of the refrigerated warehouses has residential refrigerators in the building, and that of these buildings, they each had ~2 units each. Annual Energy Consumption CBECS found that there are 15,000 refrigerated warehouses in the United States which collectively consume 7.9 TWh/yr of electricity for all refrigeration. Approximately 99%, or 7.8 TWh/yr, is believed to be from central warehouse refrigeration systems. Table 121, shown below, gives a comparison of refrigeration data between refrigerated and nonrefrigerated warehouses.

TIAX assumes that in total one unit will provide approximately 500 lbs of ice per day in healthcare facilities. Analysis of various AHRI certified units indicates that, as with the majority of units rated for greater than 280 lbs per day, the energy consumption is relatively flat as a function of unit capacity at 5.2 kWh/100 lbs of ice. Using these assumptions, the UEC is 4300 kWh/yr. Table 124 summarizes the usage characteristics that are used for ice machines in healthcare buildings in this study. 6-178 Table 124: TIAX usage assumptions for Ice Machines in Healthcare Buildings Usage Variable Units Value Annual Duty Cycle % 45 Daily Harvest Lbs 500 Energy Consumption kWh/100 lbs 5.2 Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across all healthcare buildings. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the installed base multiplied by the UEC. The 650,000 ice machines in healthcare buildings therefore consume 2.8 TWh/yr of electricity. To obtain the installed base for this calculation, TIAX assumed that the percentage of ice machines in each building type has not changed since the ADL estimates in 1991 (ADL, 1991). To update the value over the 18 years that have passed since that data was gathered, TIAX used a compound annual growth rate of 0.75%, which is an approximation of the growth rate of the number of commercial buildings in the same time period.

The power draw estimates are taken from product specification sheets and pre-installation manuals for 0.5 Tesla, 1.5 Tesla, and 3 Tesla MRI systems and weighted based on the installed base of each category. 1.5 Tesla systems are estimated to account for approximately half of the installed base. MRI equipment has significant cooling requirement in all modes of operation. The active and standby mode usage values come from conversation with industry installation experts (Johnson 2006) and hospital imaging technicians (Isom 2006), as well as from estimates for the number of annual exams.

There are short pulses of high power when the systems fire, but these high power pulses only occur for very short periods of time. Therefore, standby power dominates the average operating mode. The average power draw estimate is taken from product specification sheets and pre-installation manuals for 16 slice CT scanners, which are the standard unit based on discussions with manufacturer representatives. Furthermore, 64 slice CT scanners do not seem to have an increased power requirement. The CT equipment usage is based on an average system operating time of 58 hours per week (CIHI 2008). 6-180 Table 127: UEC calculation for CT equipment Operating Mode Value Comments/Sources Avg.

Operating 4,380 Input from industry (Isom 2006) (hours) Off 4,380 UEC (kWh/yr) 27,900 Annual Energy Consumption X-ray equipment accounts for the majority of medical imaging equipment energy consumption, mainly because of the high installed base of X-ray equipment relative to other medical imaging equipment. There are 170,000 X-ray systems consuming 4.7 TWh per year. There are 9,000 MRI systems and 16,000 CT systems, consuming 0.9 and 1.2 TWh per year, respectively. Nonetheless, the energy consumption of MRI and CT equipment has grown considerably do to the rapid installation of newer, more powerful technology. The MRI market is growing faster than radiology markets, with the number of annual exams growing between 10% and 15% per year, and the installed base of MRI systems growing 5-10% per year. Industry experts also project that 2-6 Tesla systems will gain market penetration relative to the baseline 1.5 T system. Energy efficiency has not generally been a key parameter for medical imaging equipment, although it seems that manufacturers are becoming more aware of the concerns with healthcare building energy consumption. One manufacturer now promotes a 1.5 T MRI system that consumes 40% less energy than conventional systems, claiming efficient gradient and electronics design and more efficient cooling technology. In addition to large medical imaging equipment, there are other medical imaging technologies not accounted for above. Ultrasound, dental x-ray, mammography, and fluoroscopy equipment, for example, are not included. Furthermore, there is an abundance of 6-181 other medical equipment that consumes energy. Heart rate monitors, otoophthalmoscopes, hospital beds, exam tables, exam lights, sterilizers, defibrillators, IV carts, etc. are all found in healthcare buildings. It does not appear that any one device consumes a significant amount of energy, but LBNL (2004) found that miscellaneous medical equipment consumed 1,000 kWh per 1,000 square feet of floor area for a small sample of healthcare buildings. This scales to approximately 3 TWh per year for all healthcare buildings, assuming approximately 3 billion square feet for healthcare buildings. If the buildings sampled by LBNL (2004) are representative of healthcare buildings in the U.S., there may be an installed base of over 30 million miscellaneous medical devices.

Popularity of home video game consoles could negatively affect arcade installed base in commercial buildings. Unit Energy Consumption The computationally-intensive nature of video games to generate and display elaborate graphics is the primary reason why arcades consume an appreciable amount of energy. The energy consumption of an arcade gaming machine is estimated to about 10.2 kWh per day (NUS, 2009) and thus roughly 3,700 kWh per year. In addition, NUS (2009) also claims by fitting arcade machines with timer plugs, a savings of 1860kWh per arcade machine can be achieved. This savings is used as the baseline for the best in class unit. Annual Energy Consumption Estimating the number of arcade gaming machines per establishment includes an appreciable amount of uncertainty. It is assumed that arcades are predominantly found in gaming centers and theme parks and to a lesser extent in bowling centers and cinemas, all of which are considered public assembly buildings. For this study, we assume several machines in establishments such as cinemas and bowling centers and 250 machines per gaming centers and theme parks. The latter estimate is based from the fact that some of the largest gaming centers in the U.S. house around 500 arcade gaming machines (BMI Gamings, 2009). The AEC is calculated by multiplying the UEC with the estimated installed base of arcade machines, which we estimate to be around 320,000. Since a lot of games played in arcades are also available in equally powerful, home-based video game consoles, it is foreseeable that there could be a decline in arcade machines over the coming years. This could be indicative of why a major video game manufacturer reported in 2008 that their home video games segment drove sales while their arcade operations were sluggish (CAPCOM, 2009).

Unit Energy Consumption When calculating UEC and best in class UEC, TIAX assumes a 1:1 ratio for treadmills and non-treadmill equipment where the latter is primary represented by elliptical trainers. The average power consumption during active mode for treadmills and elliptical trainers is about 855 Watts (Woody, 2009) and 200 Watts (Smooth Fitness, 2009) respectively. TIAX further infers a usage pattern for this equipment by looking at hours of operation and peak hours of a few commercial fitness centers. Best in class UEC is based on best in class models found for treadmills and lowest possible resistance settings for elliptical trainers.

Utilizing various sources such as TheGolfcourses (2009) and EPA (2009), TIAX estimates that there are about 17,000 courses in the United States. Additionally, TIAX assumes that golf courses consume a significant majority of the energy use for irrigation in the public assembly category due to the disproportionate land area associated with courses. According to the Irrigation Association, of all fresh water used in the U.S. for the purpose of irrigation, golf courses consume 1.5% (Zoldoske, 2003). From the aforementioned parameters, TIAX estimates that the AEC of golf courses is 2.4 TWh/yr. Unit Energy Consumption There are approximately 17,000 golf courses as per TheGolfcourses (2009) and EPA (2009), each with an average area of 150 acres (EPA, 2009). After calculating the total AEC, the UEC was calculated (in terms of kWh per acre per yr) to be 970 kWh/acre/yr. In addition to using more efficient pumping motors and optimizing water usage, energy saving potential of about 30% can be achieved using various novel technologies such wireless sensors (Sciencedaily, 2009) and variable frequency drive (Sciencedaily, 2009).

The installed base used in these calculations for refrigerated units is the CBECS estimate from 2003 (EIA, 2006). While broadly defined as “vending machines” in the refrigeration section of the CBECS data, it is assumed that users would respond to the survey with the number of refrigerated units due to the structure and nature of the questions (EIA, 2006). Because CBECS does not explicitly categorize non-refrigerated units, estimates for installed base were calculated as a growth adjusted estimate from ADL (ADL, 1991). For consistency sake, the percentage of total units in each category was maintained across refrigerated and non-refrigerated units. (The units/building however was not maintained such that the total installed base in the US could grow appropriately.)

Unit Energy Consumption The UEC and best in class UEC are calculated based on weighted averages of each cooking equipment type. Summarized in the table below, ADL (1993) estimates the number of cooking equipment units per building and the average power consumption for each equipment type. The best in class UEC for each equipment type is based on the highest energy reduction percentage provided by ADL (1993) when certain energy saving technologies (see Section 5.3) are applied to a particular cooking equipment type.

The installed base is calculated from the number of units in each building type from ADL (1993) and the number of buildings of that type from CBECS (EIA 2006). In the case of lodging buildings, ADL (1993) has indicated that there is a substantial amount of all types of cooking equipment. The total AEC is a sum of the AECs of each cooking equipment type in lodging buildings.

Unlike food sales buildings, however, ice machines in lodging buildings tend to be lower capacity. Manitowoc, an ice machine manufacturer based in Wisconsin, USA, recommends six pounds per room that is serviced by the unit (Manitowoc, 2009). TIAX estimates that the average unit services 25 rooms, thereby requiring a capacity of 150 lbs per day. Analysis of various AHRI certified units indicates that a unit of that size consumes approximately 9.5 kWh/100 lbs of ice. Using these assumptions, the UEC is 2300 kWh/yr. Table 155 summarizes the usage characteristics that are used for ice machines in lodging buildings in this study. Table 154: TIAX usage assumptions for Ice Machines in Lodging Buildings Usage Variable Units Value Annual Duty Cycle % 45 Daily Harvest Lbs 150 Energy Consumption kWh/100 lbs 9.5 Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across lodging buildings. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the installed base multiplied by the UEC. The 1,100,000 ice machines in lodging buildings therefore consume 2.6 TWh/yr of electricity. To obtain the installed base for this calculation, TIAX assumed that the percentage of ice machines in each building type has not changed since the ADL estimates in 1991 (ADL, 1991). To update the value over the 18 years that have passed since that data was gathered, TIAX used a compound annual growth rate of 0.75%, which is an approximation of the growth rate of the number of commercial buildings in the same time period.

For hotels, larger motels, and nursing homes, it is assumed that larger commercial laundry equipment is installed for buildings with on-site laundry. CBECS (EIA 2006) data indicate that about 72% of lodging building square footage and 82% of nursing home square footage have on-site laundry. Laundry usage in the lodging industry is approximately 9 lbs per room per day (PNNL 2008) and approximately the same for nursing home rooms (ADL 1993). PNNL (2008) estimates the average washer energy to be 1.39 kWh/load for a 60 lb washer, and 0.75 kWh/cycle for the average 75 lb gas fired commercial dryer. Assuming that two washers and two dryers are needed for every 60 guest rooms, the UEC for an average washer is 1,600 kWh/yr and 730 kWh/yr for an average dryer. The UEC for laundry equipment in dormitories is expected to be more similar to that of laundromats. The overall energy consumption is estimated to be relatively low, and was not analyzed in further detail. As indicated previously, this study only addresses the electric energy consumed laundry equipment (i.e., motors and controls). Most of the energy associated with laundry is consumed by water heaters, which heat the wash water, and by gas dryers. The gas energy is not evaluated in this study, but commercial dryers are assumed to be predominately gas fired. (ADL 1993, PNNL 2008) Annual Energy Consumption There are approximately five million hotel and motel guest rooms and 1.5 million nursing home beds in the U.S. If 72% of hotel and motel laundry is done on-site (based on the above percentage of square footage with on-site laundry), then there are 120,000 washers and 120,000 dryers installed, based on two washers and dryers per 60 rooms. Similarly, there are an estimated 40,000 washers and 40,000 dryers in nursing homes. Preliminary estimates suggest that there may be 80,000 washers and 80,000 dryers in dormitories, but 6-203 the UECs for these smaller commercial units are expected to be lower, resulting in an insignificant amount (<0.05 TWh/yr) of total energy use. The total annual energy consumption for washers and dryers in lodging buildings is estimated to be 3.6 TWh and 1.6 TWh, respectively. Federal standards were initiated for residential-style commercial washer energy and water usage in 2007. The modified energy factor (MEF) sets the amount of energy that can be consumed for the sum of water heating energy, operation energy, and post wash drying energy per load capacity. Additionally, a water factor (WF) sets the maximum amount of water that can be consumed during a wash per load capacity.

Adoption of power savings initiatives poses a challenge due to the nature of gambling operators to keep machines actively on to attract users. Unit Energy Consumption UEC is calculated from the assumption that slot machines actively operate around the clock and consume on average 400W of power (Underdahl et al., 2009). Slot machines are one of the most popular gambling methods in casinos constituting about 70% of the average casino’s income (Cooper, 2005). Per Underdahl et al., (2009) patent application a 40% reduction in power consumption is foreseeable in gaming and slot machines. Due to the legal restrictions on gambling, slot machines are only found in certain licensed establishments with the vast majority concentrated in commercial casinos, which most often are an extension of hotels or resorts, which are considered to be lodging building types. 6-207 Annual Energy Consumption The AEC is calculated by multiplying the UEC with slot machine installed base which is about 780,000 according to a study from Cummings Associates (2005).

In lodging buildings, there is very little data regarding the installed base, power draw, or usage of televisions. TIAX has estimated that installed TVs are generally in hotels, motels, nursing homes, and dormitories, and the average UEC was calculated to be 115 kWh/yr. The average UEC was calculated by estimating the UEC of TVs in two key applications. First, TVs in hotels 6-208 and motels are estimated to consume 80 kWh/yr, the equivalent of average 32 inch, 125 W TVs on for one hour per day. Second, TVs in dormitories and nursing homes were estimated to have usage more like that of residential TVs. TIAX estimates that to be the equivalent of a 30 inch, 125 W televisions that operate for four hours per day, corresponding to a UEC of 210 kWh/yr. Installed televisions are estimated to consume approximately 4 W in off mode. (TIAX 2007) Based on the estimate of four million TVs in hotels and motels and 1.5 million TVs in nursing homes and dormitories, we calculated the weighted average TV UEC in lodging buildings to be 115 kWh/yr. Annual Energy Consumption Because of the lack of data, there is significant uncertainty in the estimate of TV energy consumption in lodging buildings. However, the estimated overall AEC of 0.6 TWh/yr, is relatively low, and will have little effect on the overall study results.

The model outputs energy as a function of escalator rise and operating time. The average escalator rise based on a distribution of rises for a sample of in situ escalators. (Enermodal 2004) TIAX estimates the average usage to be approximately twelve hours per day. It is also assumed that there is an equal number of up and down escalators installed in buildings. Annual Energy Consumption In lodging buildings, there are 77,000 elevators and 1,000 escalators installed, which consume 0.4 and less than 0.1 TWh/yr, respectively.

This type of unit has a typical capacity of 75kVA and average load of 16% as per the Cadmus Group (1999) study. This includes transformers that are owned by utilities only and are on the grid-side of the meter. The installed base was obtained by dividing the AEC by the UEC. Annual Energy Consumption Typically, distribution transformer efficiencies are in the range of 97% to 99.5% (LBNL’s Energy Efficiency Standards, 2009). The aggregate energy loss attributed to distribution transformers outside of buildings is 73TWh. This value was derived from energy consumption rate per year from 1996 and from the fact that in 1996, distribution transformers used by utilities account for about 61TWh of annual energy lost in the delivery of electricity (ORNL, 1996). Around 90% of all liquid-immersed transformers are owned by electric utilities with the remaining owned by commercial and industrial customers (ORNL, 1996).

Unit Energy Consumption To be consistent with the MEL-centric nature of this study, TIAX is only concerned with the energy consumption of the air-handling component of fume hoods, i.e. the energy used to drive fans and not the energy used for conditioning of replacement air. The UEC and best in class UEC values are taken directly from (LBNL, 2009) and (LBNL, 2003) respectively. Annual Energy Consumption The AEC for all fume hoods in the U.S. was calculated by multiplying the UEC with the total installed base of approximately 750,000 according to LBNL (2003). Since there is an appreciable amount of uncertainty on how the fume hoods are distributed among building types, TIAX assumes a 50% split in distribution of fume hoods in laboratory buildings and in non-key building types (mainly offices and education buildings that contain laboratories).

In practice, the actual load factor will be less than 100% and the power consumption will be higher than the assumed value. Using a weighted average of volume servers and the much less common mid-range and high-end servers drives the UEC estimate 10% higher to 2,100 kWh/yr. Annual Energy Consumption The UEC was assumed to be consistent across all data centers. Therefore, the AEC is calculated as the installed base multiplied by the UEC. The 16 million servers in data centers in the US (Koomey, 2007) consume 32 TWh/yr.

This study: • Provides estimates of U.S. commercial MEL electricity consumption by commercial building type • Provides estimates of non-traditional commercial MELs found outside (i.e., before the electric meter) of buildings (e.g., water supply, distribution transformers) •Establishes preliminary technical energy-saving potential estimates of C-MELs using currently available, energy efficient devices and technologies •Guides energy efficiency research and activities by aggregating the results and comparing them with main load, sector, and national energy consumption totals. TIAX’s assessment of the 28 different loads was approached as a bottom-up study. That is, as opposed to beginning from total energy consumption in the U.S. and breaking down that number step by step until each category had been filled, the team collected various pieces of data and built up the estimates from the basic components. The key commercial MELs selected for further investigation are as follows: Refrigeration Other Building MELs Non-Building MELs 1. Unit Coolers 11. Slot Machines 21. Water Supply & Purification 2. Central 12. ATMs 22. Waste Water Treatment 3. Residential Type 13. Vending Machines 23. Distribution Transformers 4. Ice Machines 14. Vertical Transport 24. Mobile Phone Towers 5. Warehouse 15. Non-Road Vehicles Medical 6. Walk-in 16. Landscape Irrigation 25. Medical Imaging Consumer Electronics 17. Fitness Equipment 26. Other Medical Equip. 7. PCs 18. Laundry 27. Cooking 8. Monitors 19. Fume Hoods 28. Data Center Servers 9. Other Office Equipment 20. Arcade Machines 10. Televisions The key building MELs are those from the list of 28 that are used inside buildings. The ‘other key MELs’ include loads such as mobile phone towers or waste water treatment, which are not specifically associated with a building type, but are considered commercial MELs in this analysis. The nine building types considered include: office, retail & service (non-food), food service, food sales, education, warehouse, healthcare, lodging, and public assembly, order, and religion (AOR). These building types are consistent with the main types defined in the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), which was most recently published for 2003 by the DOE Energy Information Administration. This consistency allows for straightforward comparisons with other data sources. The CBECS defini- 7-216 tions included three individual categories, public assembly, public order, and religious, but given their lower energy consumption, TIAX combined them to form the public AOR category. The amount of information available varied from load to load, but in most cases, not all required pieces of the information were available to complete a full bottom-up analysis. TIAX made assumptions based on the best available information and our general knowledge of the loads and load trends to estimate the average UECs and installed base for the key loads. Measurements and the collection of new data were outside the scope of this report. Rather this report is intended to serve as a broad overview of C-MELs energy consumption by building type, identify data gaps and uncertainties, and guide further focused energy consumption analysis and reduction research. The uncertainty of the energy consumption and savings potential estimates varies from load to load, and at times from building type to building type. We have stated our key assumptions in Section 5 and Section 6. In generally, there is significant uncertainty in the usage patterns of MELs, and how the usage varies from one building type to the next. More power draw and installed base data is available for some of the more energy intensive MEL categories (e.g., PCs, office equipment, refrigeration, cooking), although some of the information is dated. The installed base estimates and average UEC estimates (i.e., statistically representative of the installed base) were more uncertain for the less energy intensive key building MELs that have not received as much research attention (e.g., medical equipment, fitness equipment, elevators) and for non-building MELs which historically have not been considered MELs (e.g., water supply and treatment, mobile phone towers, distribution transformers). 7.1 Energy Consumption in 2008 The evaluated key C-MELs consume a total of 504 TWh of electric energy in commercial buildings per year, or 5.5 quads of primary energy. This is 30% of the 18.3 quads consumed by the commercial energy sector, as shown in below in Table 49. 3.3 quads are associated with key building MELs while an additional 2.2 quads were consumed by other key loads not associated with specific building types (a.k.a., other key MELs). 7-217 Transportation, 28.6 Industrial, 32.9 Residential, 21.5 Main Loads, 10.2 Key Building MELs, 3.3 Other Key MELs, 2.2 Misc.

There is also a remaining “balance” after adding main loads, MELs, and miscellaneous gas loads, which may come from unaccounted for miscellaneous loads, uncertainty in the energy consumption in any category, or may be a statistical artifact resulting from summing of values from different sources. Given that 92 TWh of site electric energy is approximately equivalent to one quad of primary energy, and that a one gigawatt power plant delivers approximately eight TWh/yr of electricity, TIAX’s key MELs consume the output of more than 11 one gigawatt power plants. They account for approximately 30% of the commercial primary energy and 5.5% of the U.S. primary energy. In aggregate, the evaluated C-MELs consume more electric energy than any of the traditional building main loads, as shown below in Table 50. 12 EERE, 2009, “2009 Building Energy Data Book,” U.S. DOE.

The total energy consumption for each key C-MEL across all building types is plotted in Figure 52.

Each bar represents the energy consumption in the commercial sector for the stated key MEL. Key C-MELs were evaluated in building types in which they represented a significant load. Bars in Figure 52 that are only blue indication that for any building type in which the load was not key, it was a negligible load. The bars that also include red sections (“estimated total for non-key building types”), are an indication that a portion of the load’s energy consumption is in building types in which it is not considered a key load, but, in aggregate, is noteworthy. The pie chart in Figure 52 groups the key C-MELs into appropriate categories. Office electronics consume nearly 25% of the total. Refrigeration equipment, water supply and treatment equipment (namely, pumps), and distribution transformers (both inside and outside of buildings) each used over 80 TWh in 2008, or 16% each. 7-220 Figure 53 compares the TIAX results for several key MELs or MEL categories to other past estimates, the 2009 Building Energy Data Book (EERE 2009) and the 2003 CBECS results (EIA 2006). 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Electronics Refrigeration Computers Cooking Other Primary Energy (Quads) C‐MELs Data Comparison EIA 2008 TIAX Key 2008 CBECS 2003 TIAX Non‐Bldg MELs Figure 53: Comparison of several TIAX key MELs with other information sources There is noticeable discrepancy among the estimates for electronics. Part of the difference may be explained by the vintage of the estimates (i.e., CBECS estimates for electronics and computers may be lower because they are for 2003), and part of the difference may be due to devices included in the estimates (i.e, CBECS only includes office equipment and TIAX only includes key consumer electronics). However, it is unlikely that this fully explains the differences. There are also appreciable differences among the estimates for the ‘other’ category. It is understandable that the TIAX estimate for ‘other’ category is lower since we only addressed a set of key C-MELs, while the other estimates may include an estimate for the many smaller MELs not included in the TIAX study. The TIAX estimate for non-building MELs is likely not accounted for in the other estimates. The differences by building type between the TIAX key building MELs and the 2003 CBECS data are also shown on a per floor area basis in Figure 54 and on a per building basis in Figure 55. TIAX MEL energy intensity estimates relative to the CBECS data range from 89% higher for lodging to 37% lower for public AOR. TIAX MEL energy intensities are also higher for education and healthcare buildings, while the TIAX MEL energy intensities are lower for warehouse, food sales, food service, and office buildings. There are many potential reasons for the discrepancies seen (e.g., loads analyzed, methodology, references, vintage, etc.), that have not been addressed under this scope of work. 7-221 0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 35.0 Office Retail and Service Food Sales Food Service Education Warehouse Health Care PAO&R Lodging KWh per Square Foot (Annual) AnnualC‐MELs Intensity (KWh/sqft) CBECS TIAX Figure 54: Comparison of C-MEL energy intensity (kWh/sqft) estimates by building type between TIAX key C-MELs and 2003 CBECS data for refrigeration, cooking, PCs, office equipment, and other miscellaneous loads 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 Office Retail and Service Food Sales Food Service Education Warehouse Health Care PAO&R Lodging KWh per Building (Annual) AnnualC‐MELs Intensity (KWh/Building) CBECS TIAX Figure 55: Comparison of C-MEL energy intensity (kWh/building) estimates by building type between TIAX key C-MELs and 2003 CBECS data for refrigeration, cooking, PCs, office equipment, and other miscellaneous loads 7.2 Energy Savings Potential Using Best in Class Devices 7-222 In order to identify energy savings opportunities, TIAX selected or estimated “best-inclass (BIC)” devices from each of the 28 selected load types. For the most part, the energy consumption associated with BIC units was derived directly from energy efficient units that are currently on the market. By comparing the BIC to the typical unit used in the baseline calculations, TIAX generated a technical “energy savings potential (ESP)” for each load. Assumptions about the market penetration and impact of emerging technologies are not addressed in this study, and therefore the ESP is not necessarily fully achievable due to many market factors, but also may be more than 100% achievable in cases where new technologies are on the horizon. It is assumed that all current units are replaced by the BIC unit. The “by load”, and “by load category” energy savings potential estimates, which include estimates for both key and non-key building types, are shown below in Figure 56.

The loads with highest savings potential include PCs, monitors, walk-in refrigeration, office equipment, and distribution transformers. Each of these loads has the technical potential for a reduction of approximately 15 TWh/yr or greater. 15 Source: 2009 Buildings Energy Data Book, DOE/EERE. 2008 values interpolated from 2006 data points and 2010 projected data points – See Tables 3.14, 3.15, and 3.17. 7-223 Electronics (namely, PCs, monitors, and other office equipment) account for about 50% (88 TWh/yr) of the estimated energy savings potential. For this reason, office and education buildings show a high potential for energy savings, as shown in Figure 57. This energy savings potential is mainly driven by the potential impact of power management. Other key drivers for this energy savings are the transition from desktops to laptops (or at least to equivalent components and power saving design strategies in a desktop form factor), and the transition from CRT monitors to efficient LCD monitors. Figure 57: Energy savings potential estimate by building type 7.3 Recommendations The insights gained from this characterization of commercial MELs point to several recommendations for further study. Each one is discussed separately in the following subsections. Regular Evaluation of Rapidly Evolving MELs: A significant portion of the devices evaluated have – and, in many cases, continue to – undergone dramatic changes in their installed base, their usage, and their functionalities, characteristics, and underlying technologies (and, hence, their power draw by mode). This is particularly true of electronics (namely, office electronics and data servers), which have changed dramatically over the last couple of decades and tend to have much shorter average product lifetimes (i.e., on the order of a few years compared to ten or more for white goods), but also true of some other products as well (e.g., the increased installed base of mobile phone antennas). In all cases, it has significant ramifications for DOE’s goal of net zero-energy buildings (NZEB) in the future. Consequently, we recommend performing regular (e.g., every 3-4 years) evaluations of MEL energy consumption and energy savings potential to understand how the evolution of MELs are affecting the feasibility of cost-effectively attaining DOE’s building efficiency goals. Furthermore, we recommend that brief annual updates (executive summary style) be performed in order to keep installed base and UEC estimates current and statistically representative of the installed stock. 7-224 More Refined Evaluation and Characterization of MEL Energy-Saving Opportunities: Our initial characterization of energy-saving opportunities for commercial MELs primarily focuses on energy savings attainable using existing products. Although we found that this approach can yield overall reductions in MEL energy of about 35%, it probably is not realistic to rely on a large portion of the five million commercial buildings to purchase such “best-in-class” devices to realize large-scale savings. Furthermore, it is often very challenging to reduce the building energy consumption of many MELs via other pathways (e.g., automated controls) due to the low annual energy cost savings potential for most MELs and building owners’/operators’ disdain for measures that might adversely affect device utility or usability or impact business operations. We recommend that DOE perform a study focused on a thorough characterization of commercial MEL energy savings opportunities with an emphasis on a critical assessment of the likelihood that a large portion of real buildings would accept and effectively deploy different measures. Ultimately, this could be used to develop a roadmap for credibly achieving major (e.g., 35%) reductions in MELs that identifies the technologies and policies needed to reach realize those reductions. We recommend two different potential approaches: a) Focus on large (>50,000 square feet) buildings, which consume 50% of the key MEL energy, but are only 5% (~250,000) buildings. These buildings may also see appreciable reductions in operating costs from energy savings measures, and therefore may be more amenable to adopting such measures. b) Focus on high impact technology categories. While the study analyzes tens of loads and the potential energy savings measures associated with each one, the technology used to achieve those savings can probably be summarized in approximately ten categories. By using this approach, DOE can facilitate greater energy savings by targeting core technologies that affect multiple loads at the same time. For example, by targeting high efficiency screens with advanced LED or even OLED backlighting, DOE can make an impact on the energy consumption of monitors, ATMs, slot machines, arcade games, and more. Data Gathering by Building Type to Fill Key Data Gaps: TIAX found a lack of current data, particularly by building type, for many C-MEL to develop accurate bottom-up estimates. We recommend that the DOE conduct power measurements by mode for a sample representative of the installed base for key C-MELs in key building types. Likewise, interviews, surveys, or actual measurements are needed to more accurately understand the usage patterns of key MELs in key building types. Obtaining real operating data can be time and budget intensive, and therefore a focused work plan is needed to fill the largest data gaps with the largest impact on energy consumption. We recommend starting with large commercial buildings (i.e., greater than 50,000 square feet).

USE OF BANKOTES
Counterfeit notes

In terms of section 14 of the SARB Act, only the SARB has the right to issue banknotes and coin in South Africa. Any reproduction of banknote images – even for artistic or advertising uses – is strictly forbidden.
Counterfeit currency are imitation notes or coin produced without the legal sanction of the SARB. Counterfeiting currency and the possession thereof are crimes.
By law, counterfeit notes found in circulation cannot be exchanged for cash, as they have no value. To confirm the validity of a banknote, the approach of Look, Feel and Tilt can be used.
The SARB, the South African Police Service and the commercial banks work together to combat the counterfeiting of banknotes and coin. Members of the public who come into possession of counterfeit banknotes and coin must immediately report it to their nearest police station.
 
Damaged or mutilated bank notes

A banknote is deemed mutilated when its condition requires special examination to validate. Such banknotes could be burnt, discoloured, decomposed, or damaged with portions missing.
In terms of section 14(4) of the SARB Act, the SARB is not obliged to make any payment in respect of mutilated banknotes, but will consider the merits of each case. As such, mutilated banknotes may be exchanged at the SARB Head Office in Pretoria or designated commercial bank branches, where the value to be paid will be evaluated against specific criteria.
 

Mutilated banknotes can also be exchanged at a commercial bank where an individual’s account is held. Designated commercial bank branches will then assess the value in line with the above guiding principles. For a list of designated branches, please see Commercial bank PDF.
 
Contaminated or dye-stained banknotes

A banknote is deemed dye-stained when it displays staining patterns from a currency degradation system.
These devices degrade banknotes, making them unusable and discouraging criminals from stealing them. As these banknotes are considered the proceeds of crime, they have no value and cannot be exchanged.
Dye-stained banknotes should under no circumstances be accepted. Members of the public who unwittingly come into possession of these banknotes cannot claim from the SARB, and are advised to hand in these banknotes at their nearest police station.

Examples of dye-stained banknotes:

Currency protection device

Currency protection devices (CPDs) protect banknotes from theft by degrading their integrity, making them unusable.
The SARB regulates the use of CPDs in accordance with the SARB Act. Only CPDs or systems that are tested and formally approved by the SARB may be used to protect cash.
All enquires or applications for testing and requests for approval of CPDs, security ink or any other banknote degradation systems must be directed to: CPD@resbank.co.za.
 
Use of banknote images
 
The SARB has the sole authority to produce and issue banknotes and coin. It also has sole discretion to give or refuse permission to reproduce images of its currency.
 
Entities or persons who would like to reproduce images of the currency can only do so under specific approved circumstances. The images must not be reproduced with the intention of misleading or defrauding the public, and must maintain the dignity of any national symbol.
More details on the guidelines for reproducing banknotes can be found here.
Images in this gallery are available for non-commercial use only. They can be used and reproduced provided the following conditions are met:
•	the photographs are reproduced accurately and without alterations;
•	the SARB is identified as the source; and
•	its use does not contravene the SARB Act or the policy on the reproduction of images of the South African currency.

THE BASICS OF AN ELECTRONICS CIRCUIT DESIGN PROCESS
Table of Contents
 
What is Meant by Circuit Design?
The term “circuit design” refers to creating electronic circuits. It can range from individual transistors in an integrated circuit to complex circuits. For simple design circuits, one person can often do the entire process. However, a circuit designer is not necessary for every project.
As a designer, you must know the functions you want to create to create a circuit that fulfills them. Then, once the circuit is complete, you must test and verify it to ensure it meets your needs. The verification process is highly mathematical and sometimes involves large-scale computer simulations. In addition, the verification process must follow specific rules to ensure the circuit works properly.
When designing a circuit, you should consider how it will function and its location. This will help you make changes without wasting money on something that will not work. Fortunately, circuit design software programs make this process fast and easy. In addition, these programs help you test different electronic circuit design to ensure they will function correctly in the real world.
In addition to design, circuit designers must also be aware of the latest trends in security. This way, they can ensure that their designs are secure against hackers. They can also educate their customers about potential attacks. Working as a circuit designer is an exciting career choice because it allows you to work on different projects and utilize your creativity. You can also make a real impact on people’s lives as you design and develop new products.

Rules for Creating a Circuit

In creating a circuit, we need to identify the nodes and junctions. Nodes are the connections that allow an electrical current to flow between two points. Junctions are two points that share the same electric potential. The number of nodes in a circuit depends on the circuit’s type.
A circuit generally has three essential components: a conductive path, a non-conductive path, and a power source. All electrical equipment needs a source of energy to function. The energy source should be capable of moving electricity from a low-energy location to a high-energy location.
The first rule of electrical circuits is that a closed conducting path must extend from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. A closed conducting path is also known as a loop. The amount of electricity flowing through a loop is directly proportional to the amount of resistance, which is known as the voltage drop. Ohms’ law can calculate the voltage across a series of resistors.
The second rule of design circuits is the ability to control electricity flow. A circuit must not generate more electricity than its capacity. Otherwise, the battery and wire will heat up and run out of juice.
Process
Design circuits have several building blocks. These include transistors, resistors, capacitors, and wires. The building blocks are then connected to create more complex circuits. Finally, they are combined to create more sophisticated devices such as logic gates, precision amplifiers, adders, and multipliers. Each successive building block increases in complexity.
The circuit elements are assembled on the silicon substrate to perform an objective function. This is called the “physical design” process. First, we implement the fundamental circuit elements in geometric shapes on a silicon substrate. These elements must match the required specifications. Therefore, when designing a circuit, it is crucial to consider the manufacturing process.
It is essential to follow a systematic layout for easy viewing when designing a circuit. While we can draw circuits by hand for simple circuits, more complex circuit designs require using ECAD software. In many cases, a client will specify ECAD software in their job description. A professional ECAD tool will have the necessary features to create schematics, layout designs of a PCB, artwork, bill of materials, and Gerber files.
Switches interrupt the flow of current and activate different features in a circuit. They are binary devices – either ON or OFF – which control the circuit’s work. Switches are mechanical devices with two terminals connected to metal contacts.
The electronic circuit design process comprises two main stages: analysis and synthesis. This process requires the designer to accurately predict the voltage and current at every node in a circuit. Ideally, a designer should be able to predict the output of the circuit at each node, including the power supplies. While hand analysis is possible, computer-aided circuit analysis is a more efficient way to create electronic circuits, saving time and money.

Electronic Circuit Development Strategies
While developing an electronic circuit, there are several key factors to consider in the product development cycle. One of the most important aspects is the integrity of the production process. Communicating any changes made to the schematic to the mechanical and purchasing teams is essential. Since electronic circuits are critical and vital, engineers need to use software that is easy to use and can document every change made.
Circuits need to be compact and have reliable interconnections among their components. As devices get smaller, overlapping wires cause interferences, which can cause them to malfunction.
A basic circuit consists of a current source, conductors, and a load. The source and load connects to a power source. A circuit’s primary purpose is to allow electricity to flow. The voltage source is a two-terminal device that provides the potential difference required for current to flow through a circuit. Another essential element is the load or device that consumes electricity. The simplest load is a light bulb, but more complex circuits can contain many different loads.
Factors to Consider When Creating a Circuitry Design
 
When creating a circuitry design, there are several factors to consider. First, you should understand the basic building blocks of the circuit and how they work together. Once you know this, you can begin designing a circuit. Putting these basic building blocks together is not always simple, and it may take some practice.
Integrated Circuits parameters
IC parameters refer to the specifications of various elements of integrated circuits. These parameters affect the performance of the IC by controlling its speed, power dissipation, and heat generation. Therefore, we must consider these parameters at every level of the electronic circuit design process. When implementing advanced circuitry, it is essential to keep the following factors in mind:
Physical design involves creating circuit elements on a silicon wafer. The process begins with a “chip floor plan,” which outlines the chip’s functions, inputs, and outputs. We then place circuit elements in a silicon substrate in preparation for manufacturing. Often, custom layout techniques meet specific design requirements. A software tool called integrated circuits layout editor is used to achieve this.
Passive components
Passive components are essential to electronic circuits and devices. They can reduce the amount of electricity flowing through a circuit, store energy, and produce inductance. Passice components can also help increase voltage and current. These components are helpful in most electronic circuits. Some common examples of passive components include incandescent bulbs and loudspeakers. Loudspeakers use transducers to cause their cones to vibrate to create sound waves. Transducers are also helpful in radio frequency applications. We can find them in GPS devices, radios, wireless routers, and modems.
Passive components are also important in PCB design. Most PCB designers have to incorporate passive electronic components into their layouts. They must be able to find accurate PCB footprints for these components and understand how to use existing footprints for new components. However, some ECAD software libraries only include a small selection of through-hole or SMD components. To avoid this problem, designers should add common PCB footprints to their libraries.

Ground plane
When designing circuits, it’s essential to consider the ground plane. The ground plane is the conductive path from a component to the rest of the circuit. It should be free from conductive rings to prevent electromagnetic interference. It can cause ground loops and external magnetic fields if it’s not. A ground plane must run underneath electronic components, but it shouldn’t cover the entire bottom layer. If this is not possible, it may require adjusting the layout of components and traces.
Ground planes also improve signal integrity. Using a ground plane can help ensure that the circuit will not experience crosstalk between signal traces. This reduces noise and improves the signal integrity of high-speed transmission lines.
Current return path
Designing circuits is challenging and requires knowledge of the fundamental building blocks and methods. By understanding these, you can develop an electronic circuit design that works. Unfortunately, putting these building blocks together is not always easy and may take a few attempts before you get it right.
Avoiding parallel tracks
When designing circuits, parallel tracks can cause crosstalk. The amount of crosstalk depends on the tracks’ length and proximity. It is best to keep traces separated at a distance of less than 90 degrees to reduce the amount of crosstalk. Also, when designing circuits, avoid using parallel tracks when you can.
High-speed circuit design rules
When designing high-speed military circuits, avoiding signals too close to PCB edges is the best way to minimize routing errors. However, this can cause issues with trace impedance and signal integrity. It’s also a good idea to separate analog and digital ground planes. To make routing easier, place two reference planes, one for digital and one for analog, and place components underneath them.
High-speed electronic circuit design rules also include avoiding stub traces, which can act as antennas and cause reflections. A common source of stubs is the pull-up or pull-down resistors used in high-speed signal paths. We should also carefully choose signal return paths, as the wrong choice can cause noise coupling and EMI problems. Also, avoiding using unused pads in your layout is a good idea.

Building Blocks in an Electronic Circuit Design
 
Electronic circuit design involves the analysis and synthesis of electrical and electronic circuits. It combines the science of mathematics with the art of design. It is essential for the development of electronic devices. Electronic circuit design is rapidly growing, with numerous applications in various fields. It also includes the design of digital and analog circuits and various integrated circuits.
Analog circuits
Analog circuit design is creating an electronic circuit that uses analog components. This includes diodes, capacitors, transistors, and operating amplifiers. Analog circuits are much slower than their digital counterparts, but they have the advantage of simplicity and flexibility.
Analog circuits use only a small number of components. They usually connect to devices that collect environmental signals and send them back. In contrast, digital circuits use a logic one or a zero to represent a signal. However, digital circuits have a large margin for error, so they are less commonly used in electronic circuits.
Digital circuits
Digital circuits are helpful in a wide variety of applications. They convert continuous streams of analog values to discrete ones stored in memory and processed by other digital systems. These circuits are fundamental building blocks of modern electronics. In simple terms, a digital circuit represents information as discrete voltages, such as 0V and 5V, which correspond to true and false in the boolean logic system. On the other hand, an analog circuit represents information as a continuous range of voltage.
Digital circuits consist of a switch and one or more components. The simplest circuits use a diode, a resistor, a capacitor, and a power supply. Other circuits use a series of transistors or diodes to add and subtract bits.
Test & Measurement
Electronic circuits need testing for their performance and reliability. We can do this in the design phase and the day-to-day maintenance of electronic circuits. Among the many types of testing equipment available, the digital multimeter is one of the most versatile. These instruments allow you to measure several circuit parameters, such as voltage, resistance, and continuity.
Many applications require digital input and output capability. National Instruments offers a wide range of digital I/O products that allow you to measure voltage, speed, and timing.
Component layout diagrams
Component layout diagrams show the layout of electronic circuits. This type of diagram is also called a schematic diagram. A capacitor, for example, has two terminals, one positive and one negative. It’s important to note that the polarity of a capacitor should not mix, as it can result in a battery explosion.
Component placement in a schematic is essential. The layout engineer must keep the components in their right positions in the circuit. For example, in a radio receiver circuit, the antenna input would be located at the left, while the loudspeaker would be at the right. Similarly, the connections to the positive and negative power supplies are visible at the top and bottom of the schematic. Another way to make a schematic more readable is to highlight the principal signal paths.
Joystick switches
Joystick switches in electronic circuit design use various techniques to sense user motion and convert it into electrical signals that the device’s software can use. Early analog joysticks sensed movements using a potentiometer, a variable resistor. The motion of a sliding wiper blade across a fixed contact mirrored changes in the joystick’s position. These early systems were generally sensitive to wear on the sliding component.
Modern joysticks use contactless technology and generate a magnetic field at the base of the shaft. The sensing part detects this field, which then outputs a corresponding analog voltage proportional to the distance the joystick moves. As a result, modern joysticks are extremely durable, typically lasting for five million cycles without failure. They also support a variety of configurations, including standard orthogonal and mixing signals.

Power supplies
Power supplies are critical to the successful design of electronic circuits. However, they can be expensive and must meet specific requirements. Fortunately, various tools are available to help designers make better decisions about power supplies. These tools include simulation tools that analyze power supply designs to uncover important electronics design insights. Then, depending on your circuit’s power requirement, they can help you choose the right type of power supply and component package.
There are two basic types of power supplies, regulated and unregulated. Each has different advantages and disadvantages. For example, the regulated power supply provides stable output voltage, whereas an unregulated power supply has a wide input voltage and a narrow output range.
Use of Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers can help develop electronic circuits that have a variety of functions and are small in size. A microcontroller has programmable pins that can work as inputs or outputs. The STM32F042 microcontroller, for example, has pin 9 labeled PA3. This pin is programmed to serve several functions, including receiving input for serial communication, timer output, and an I/O pin for a capacitive touch sensor controller.
Microcontrollers typically comprise a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chip, making them susceptible to static charges. This makes them suitable for electronic circuits, although the static charges can damage these devices.
The microcontroller has input and output ports, which connect to real-world devices. These can be temperature sensors, push buttons, or motion sensors. These signals then go to the CPU, deciding what to do with the data. We can convert inputs to outputs in various ways, and the CPU can send signals to LED lights or motors based on the inputs. For example, a temperature sensor connected to a motor can control the temperature in a room.
In addition to their input and output ports, microcontrollers have memory elements, such as data memory, to store data temporarily while instructions are executing. However, the data memory is volatile and is maintained only if the device is powered. Input ports receive information, usually in binary form. The processor then sends instructions to the output devices, which execute tasks outside the microcontroller.
Using Decoupling and Coupling Capacitors
Capacitors are essential in electronic circuits to filter noise and enhance the circuit’s functionality. There are two types of capacitors: decoupling and coupling. A decoupling capacitor is a small, reactive capacitor placed between an IC and its load on the board. It serves as a buffer against incoming AC noise.
The placement of a decoupling capacitor is critical in electronic circuit design. You should place it as close to the chip as it should decouple. However, the proper placement of a decoupling capacitor depends on the underlying physics of the circuit.
Decoupling capacitors need time to charge and discharge before providing the required current. They also need to resist quick voltage changes and provide energy for maintaining a stable voltage. The capacitors should be the right size for the circuit and the desired application.
Decoupling capacitors can also reduce the sensitivity of an IC to power noise and ripple. Decoupling, or separating two circuits, reduces the noise by acting as a charge reservoir and shunting the transient current to the ground. It also helps maintain the constant power supplies of the IC.

Using Pull-Up and Pull-Down Resistors in Electronic components
Pull-up and pull-down resistors are electrical components that act as voltage and current limiters. They allow a small amount of current to leak while preventing a logical low state at the input. When used in electronic circuits, they are also helpful for circuits containing a pushbutton switch.
The purpose of pull-up resistors is to define the voltage when there is no driving signal. Its value may vary depending on the application, but it is typically in the range of 4.7kilo ohms.
Pull-up resistors are essential in digital logic circuits. A digital logic circuit has three states: high, low, and high impedance. When you do not pull a pin to its logic level, it enters the high-impedance state. By using pull-up resistors, you can solve this issue.
Pull-down resistors work the same way as pull-up resistors but pull a low-impedance pin. To use a pull-down resistor in electronic circuits, connect it between a pin on the microcontroller and a ground terminal. Connecting a pull-down resistor between a pin and the ground terminal makes a switch between the two states.
Using Transistor ARRAYS/PAIRS in Electronic Circuit Design
One of the fundamental building blocks when designing a circuit is a transistor. Understanding the basic building blocks and how to combine them will help you build a circuit more efficiently. However, putting the basic building blocks together will not be easy so practice will be necessary.
The Darlington Pair is a common example of a transistor array/pair circuit. This circuit configuration combines two or three transistors on a chip, with each transistor’s emitter connected to the base of the next. The circuit configuration has a high current gain and is especially useful for driving low-impedance loads.
Resistor Wattage in Electronic Circuit Designing
Resistors help regulate the flow of electricity in electronic circuits. They are available in various sizes, and we can classify them by their wattage. The power supplies rating of a resistor can be measured using a standard equation. So, the wattage of a resistor can range from a few milliwatts to several kilowatts.
The wattage of a resistor is a function of its current and output voltage. The higher the current and voltage, the higher the wattage. A typical rule of thumb is to use at least twice as much as the power supplies needed. Therefore, you can put two resistors in parallel to achieve a higher power rating.
In addition, resistors have their tolerance bands. Typically, they display a tolerance of +5% and -10%. The tolerance band on a resistor is a gold or silver ring. A gold resistor is considered in good operational condition when it falls within the tolerance band. If the tolerance is higher than this, you should replace it.
We can find resistors in a wide variety of packages. For example, SIP-9 packages contain eight individual 47-ohm resistors. Each resistor has a separate pin for its external connection. The other ends connect to a common pin. The SIP-9 package is a standard package for passive SMD components, although some designs use different packages. Increasingly, new designs are moving towards very small packages. This helps designers pack more functionality into a smaller space.
Understanding the Discharge Time of Batteries in Electronic Circuits
When designing a battery system, you should understand the discharge time of batteries. Batteries should charge up to a point where they have a discharge time equal to the device’s lowest voltage. This voltage is known as the open circuit voltage. When there is no load on the battery, the open circuit voltage is 0 V. You should not discharge batteries beyond this point. To calculate the discharge time of a battery, you need to know the battery’s State of Charge (SOC) and depth of discharge (DOD).
The discharge time of batteries is also known as the discharge current. This value provides the starting point for determining the battery’s capacity. We measure the rate of discharge in amp-hours. In other words, the rate of charge flow is directly proportional to the discharge time of a battery.
Various types of batteries have different charging rates. For example, lead acid batteries should never discharge completely before recharging them. Moreover, the charge rate depends on the effective surface area of the electrodes.
A battery’s discharge time is a vital component of the design of your battery. It is essential to understand the discharge time of the battery so that you can choose the right battery. A battery’s capacity is in amp-hours, but this can vary. When designing a battery for high-power applications, you should consider its discharge time.

How to Develop and Prototype Electronic Devices
Creating a prototype is one of the critical steps in developing new electronic products. It is a great way to troubleshoot problems with the finished product and refine its features. It can also serve as a realistic representation of the finished product. This article will provide you with tips on how to develop successful circuit prototypes for your product.
Building functional electronic circuit prototypes is not as difficult as it may sound. It is similar to drawing a design, but instead of just using paper and pens, you need to take the time to build it out of electrical components and hardware. The process of electronic prototype development has two stages: PCB prototyping and actual product prototyping. PCB prototyping involves developing electronic circuit boards, while electronic circuits prototyping focuses on the electronic circuit design and functionality of the finished product.
Once the circuit prototypes are complete, the next step is to validate the design and optimize the production of the final product. Again, having a contract prototype allows for the early detection of any design flaws, assembly problems, or scalability issues.
The product development phase begins with an idea for a new electronic device. The first step in the process is idea generation, where developers and designers focus on user needs and brainstorm to create the next big thing. Idea generation is a complex process and often takes a lot of time.

Cassette based document handling system
Abstract
A cassette (20) for a currency handling system includes a door (28) that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the cassette. An end door (30) is operable to be opened to allow currency that is disposed within the interior of the cassette (20) to be urged outward. The cassette (20) has a locking mechanism disposed in an end (72), which locking mechanism prevents the door from opening until the cassette (20) is disposed in a docking station. Once in the docking station, a paddle (56) is urged downward into the cassette (20) to urge the notes outward therefrom. These notes are moved into a buffer region (58) and then the cassette (20) can be removed to allow another cassette (20) to be disposed therein. This allows a continuous feeding operation. The cassette (20) can then be disposed in a second collection docking station to collect the output of the sorter (41). In this docking station, a paddle (68) is reciprocated downward into the cassette (20) with the collected notes.

Description
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention pertains in general to a document handling system and, more particularly, to a currency handling system that utilizes a cassette for transporting currency between stations.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
After currency is distributed in the public sector, it will typically find its way back into the banking institutions. This is facilitated through individuals depositing currency documents in their local banking institutions, and businesses forwarding their cash receipts to the banking institutions. Once the banking institutions have received the currency in the form of the notes, these notes must then be processed. Although the processing can be facilitated by hand, this is somewhat tedious. To facilitate the large number of notes that must be sorted, counted and then re-bundled or "strapped" for distribution back to the banks, large high speed currency sorting machines have been developed.
Currency sorting machines typically have a feeder slot into which stacks of currency in different denominations and even different sizes can be placed. The currency sorter will then individually strip the notes or documents from the feeder slot, pass them through various sensing stations to determine the denomination of the note and even the quality or integrity of the note. Once this is done, then the sorting machine will deposit the note in a collection slot associated with the proper denomination. Typically, a separate collection slot is provided for notes that are defective due to, for example, a tear or excessive wear. These sorting machines can sort notes at rates up to 2,000 notes per minute.
The disadvantage to present sorting systems is the manner in which the notes must be transported between stations. Typically, there are three stations, the first being the initial hand sorting or collection operation at the original banking institution, the second being the feeder operation to the sorter and the third being the collection operation at the sorter. Due to the high speed nature of the sorter, the sorter typically outstrips the speed at which the documents can be placed into the sorter and then removed from the sorter. Therefore, there exists a need for a system that will facilitate an increase in the throughput.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention disclosed and claimed herein comprises a method and apparatus for transferring documents utilizing a portable cassette having a cover that can be opened to expose the documents or closed in a secured and locked manner to prevent access to documents contained therein. The cassette is loaded at a first station in an open configuration to provide a stack of documents therein, and, after loading, the cassette is locked. The loaded cassette is then transported to a second location in the locked configuration, and then disposed in an unloading docking station.
The loaded cassette is opened to expose at least one end of the stack, and then the stack of documents in the loaded cassette is urged out of the loaded cassette through the at least one end into a buffer region that is continually moving. This allows the contents of the cassette to become part of the documents in the buffer region. The cassette is removed after urging the documents therefrom and after the documents have cleared the at least one end. The unloading operation is then continuously repeated with a new loaded cassette.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a diagrammatic view of the process flow for a document handling system of the present invention, which utilizes a cassette for transporting currency. The process flow is provided by three stations, a hand load station 10, a feeder station 12 and a collection station 14. Initially, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, currency is hand loaded into a cassette. Typically, the cassettes are delivered to a banking institution in an open configuration, there being a locking system that allows the cassette to be placed into a closed and secure configuration. These cassettes are stacked in a compact manner such that an operator can remove the open cassette from the stack, place it on what is referred to as a "desktop station" and then proceed to load the currency therein. Typically, the currency is counted at the banking institution by hand, placed in some type of bundle and then disposed in the cassette. There may be some type of separator card with a bar code disposed thereon which can be utilized at the central banking institution for identification. Once the currency is hand loaded into the cassette, the cassette is then closed and placed in a secure configuration. Once it is in this configuration, it cannot be opened until it is placed onto another docking station that has a key system for unlocking the cassette.
After the cassettes are hand loaded and secured, they are then placed on some type of transport or given to an individual that has the responsibility for the transport. The loaded cassettes are then transported to a sorting facility. The sorting facility contains both the feeder station 12 and the collection station 14. Of course, the sorting facility may be in the next room from the hand loading station 10. At the feeder station 12, the loaded cassettes can be sequentially disposed in the feeder station to allow high speed feeding and high speed sorting. Further, as will be described hereinbelow, this is a continuous feeding operation.
In the continuous feeding operation, a cassette is retrieved from the transport mechanism or the stack and placed onto a docking station associated with the feeding station 12. When it is placed on the docking station, this action unlocks the cassette and allows the door for the cassette to be opened and providing access to the contents. Once access is obtained, then the operator configures the feeding station to urge the notes out of the cassettes and into a buffer region. Once all the bills are urged out of cassette and into the buffer region, the cassette can then be removed in an open position and then a new loaded and locked cassette placed therein and the procedure continues.
Once the cassette is placed into the feeder station 12, the bills that are accessed are placed behind the previous notes in the buffer region. Therefore, the interior of the cassette and the buffer region constitute a feeding supply to the sorting system. The urging of the notes out of the cassette is the same operation that urges the notes in the buffer region up into interface with the sorting mechanism. This is a constant operation with the notes continually urged upward into the sorting mechanism, such that when a new cassette is placed into the feeding mechanism, the previous notes are still in the buffer region to provide a "seamless" feeding operation. The notes are fed at approximately 1,500 notes per minute and a typical cassette will contain about 2,000 notes.
The sorting mechanism is operable to retrieve the notes from the feeding mechanism, evaluate those notes for the integrity of the notes, orientation and also the denomination of the notes. The notes are then "slotted" into different collection slots. The open cassettes are placed into a docking station in the collection slot, similar to the docking station in the feeder slot, and then the notes collected therein. Once the notes are collected, the cassette can then be locked and removed for subsequent processing.
Referring now to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a block diagram of desktop station 16 for use in the hand loading station 10. The desktop station 16 is a box that has a tilted receiving surface 18. The tilted receiving surface 18 is operable to receive a cassette 20 on the surface thereof The desktop station 16 has at the lower end of the surface 18 a tilting door 22, which door 22 is operable to cover a locking mechanism (not shown). The door 22 is spring loaded, such that when the cassette 20 is removed, the door 22 will swing closed to cover the locking mechanism. This provides both a protective cover and a technique to ensure that the cassette 20 will be placed on the surface 18 above the locking mechanism, such that it will be on the same plane as the locking mechanism before engaging the locking mechanism.
The cassette 20 is comprised of a left side 24 and a right side 26. A tambour door 28 is disposed on the cassette 20, such that it can be pulled over the top opening of the cassette 20. An end door 30 is provided on one end thereof which is operable to cover an end opening. Therefore, the door 28 can be slidingly moved over the top opening and a portion of the end opening and, in conjunction with the door 30, completely seal the cassette 20. A window 32 is provided on the right side 26 and a window 36 is provided on the left side 24, which windows 32 and 36 are operable to allow a user to view the interior contents thereof to determine if there are notes in the cassette 20 after locking. A sliding compression panel 38 is provided which slides along the length of the interior of the cassette 20 to allow notes 40 which are disposed between the compression panel 38 and the opening to be stacked tightly within the cassette 20. The operation of the cassette 20 and the interior workings thereof will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
In the operation of the desktop station 16, the cassette 20 is operable to the stored in a stacked configuration with other cassettes 20, all the cassettes 20 being in an open configuration in the preferred embodiment. When a user desires to fill one of the cassettes 20, the open cassette 20 is retrieved from its storage area and disposed on the desktop station 16. It is not necessary for the desktop station 16 to have an interfacing locking mechanism that is disposed under the door 22, but this is available and shown in this embodiment. The only purpose for the mechanism under the door 22 is to provide a key mechanism for unlocking the locking mechanism internal to the cassette 20. Again, this will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
The operator, after disposing the cassette 20 on the desktop station 16, then hand loads the notes 40 into the interior of the cassette between the compression panel 38 and the end opening of the cassette 20. Typically, the compression panel 38 can be moved toward the bottom or opposite end from the open end, to provide access to the full capacity of the cassette 20. Once the notes 40 are loaded into the cassette 20 to the desired capacity, which may be the full capacity, the compression panel 38 is moved toward the open end and the closed door 30 to "pack" the notes and the door 28 is then slidingly moved upward toward the end opening proximate the door 30, this motion then locking the cassette 20 if a corresponding key mechanism is not available, otherwise the cassette 20 must be removed from the desktop station 16 to lock the cassette 20. The cassette 20 is then removed from the desktop station 16 and disposed on a transport mechanism for transport to the next station, the feeder station 12.
Referring now to FIG. 3, there is illustrated a perspective view of a sorting mechanism 41, which FIG. 3 does not illustrate the details of the sorting mechanism 41. However, the sorting mechanism 41 is operable to retrieve documents, such as notes, from a point 42 and deliver them to one of two points 44 or 46, only two delivery points noted for simplicity purposes. The sorting mechanism 41 is conventional and known by those skilled in the art.
The sorting mechanism 41 has a feeder docking station for feeding notes to the point 42 and two collection docking stations for receiving notes delivered to the points 44 and 46, respectively. When the cassette 20 is transported from the desktop station 16, after locking thereof, the cassette 20 is then disposed in the feeder docking station, which is comprised of a buffer region 48 and a docking region 50. The docking region 50 has associated therewith a key mechanism, similar to the key mechanism disposed under the door 22 in the desktop station 16 of FIG. 2. It is operable to be disposed in the docking region 50 and the key mechanism engaged, such that the door 28 can now be slidingly moved down toward the unopen end of the cassette 20 to expose all of the notes therein. The door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface to allow the notes 40 within the cassette 20 to be moved to the buffer region 48, the surface of the cassette 20, the surface of the door 30 and the lower surface of the buffer region 48 being coplanar.
It can be seen in the embodiment of FIG. 3 that there are a plurality of notes 54 that are disposed in the buffer region 48. These notes 54 are urged upward toward the point 42 with the use of a "paddle" 56. The paddle 56 is mounted on a feeding mechanism 58, which feeding mechanism 58 is operable to reciprocate the paddle along the length of the docking region 50 and buffer region 48. The paddle 56, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, is operable to be reciprocated upward and moved down into the unopen end of the cassette 20 and then pushed down into the cassette 20. It is only necessary for the paddle 56 to rise up high enough to clear the sides of the cassette 20.
In operation, the embodiment of FIG. 3 is illustrated wherein the notes 54 and the buffer region were previously fed in from prior cassette 20. The paddle 56 therefore had cleared the prior cassette and is fully within the buffer region 48, continually urging the notes 54 upward to the point 42. This urging of the notes 54 upward to the point 42 allows the sorting mechanism to strip the notes off. This stripping operation operates at approximately 1,500 notes per minute. When the new cassette 20 is disposed within the docking region 50, the operator in one embodiment then urges the notes 40 upward against the back surface of the paddle 56 and then moves the paddle 56 out of contact with the notes 54 in the buffer region 48 and then moves it vertically upward from the surface of the feeder station and then urges it downward along the length of the feeder station toward the closed end of the cassette 20 until it is proximate to the bottom of the notes 40. The paddle 56 is then engaged with the bottom of the notes 40, such that the notes 40 and the notes 54 now comprise one stack of notes. The paddle 56 then automatically urges the entire combined stack of notes 40 and 54 upward to the point 42. As soon as sufficient notes have been stripped off the top of the combined stack and the combined stack clears the cassette 20, the cassette 20 can be removed and another cassette provided. During this removal, the cassette 20 is allowed to remain open.
In the next operation, the operator will proceed to the next station, the collection station. In this mode, the cassette 20 is disposed within one of the collection docking stations. Each of the collection docking stations has a buffer region 60 and a docking region 62. The buffer region 60 is typically smaller than the buffer region 48, approximately six inches, but it has a similar key device as the feeder docking station in the event that a closed cassette is disposed therein. Once disposed in the docking region 62, the door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface. A feeding mechanism 64 is provided that runs along the length of both buffer region 60 and docking region 62 and has a paddle 68 associated therewith. The paddle 68 is operable to reciprocate downward from the associated one of the points 44-46 as notes are fed therein and will move downward into the associated cassette 20. Once the sorter has determined that the capacity of the cassette 20 has been reached, i.e., the desired note count, it will discontinue routing notes to that particular collection location. The user will then remove the cassette 20, close the door 28 and then store the notes. Typically, there will be some type of bar code for identification purposes on a particular cassette which can be entered into a computer to provide some type of tracking ability. A reader could be implemented for automatically reading the bar code as the cassette is disposed on its associated feeder docking station, collection docking station, or desktop station.
Referring now to FIG. 4, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 in the open position. Each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed around the peripheral edges on the inner side thereof a slot 70 which is a guide slot for the door 28. An end cap 72 is provided to cover the locking mechanism (not shown) and has two groups of three key access holes 74 and 76. The end cap 72 covers the end portion of the door 28 also. However, one of its primary functions is to hide the key mechanism to prevent unlocking of the system and also to protect the locking mechanism.
Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, there are illustrated side views of the left and right sides 24 and 26, respectively. Each of the left and right sides 24 and 26 have associated therewith a rack 78 with a surface extending upward. Each of these racks 78 is operable to interface with a toothed gear 80, as shown in FIG. 4. The left side 24 has disposed below the rack 78 a horizontal slot 84 that runs along the length of the rack 78, whereas the right side 26 has disposed below the rack 78 a plurality of vertical slots 86. The horizontal slot 84 is a guide slot for the compression panel 38, whereas the vertical slots 86 are locking slots, as will be described hereinbelow. In addition, each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed in the open end thereof a slot 90 and a slot 92, respectively, with each of the slots 90 and 92 having a detent 94 associated therewith. The detent 94 is operable to receive a pan head pin 96 on the right side of the door 30, the slot 90 operable to receive a similar pan head pin (not shown). The door 30, as will be described hereinbelow, is operable to reciprocate vertically in the closed position, such that the pin 96 can reciprocate downward into the detent 94. The left and right sides 24 and 26 are fabricated from a plastic material and the pan head pin 96 extends outward over the edge of the slot 90, it being a large diameter, such that it will prevent an individual from prying the sides 24 and 26 apart, gaining entrance thereto and then placing them back together. As will be described hereinbelow, when the door 28 is closed, it overlaps the door 30, preventing it from reciprocating upward and the pan head pin 96 rotating out of the slot 92.
Referring now to FIG. 7, there is illustrated an end view of the compression panel 38. The compression panel 38 is manufactured of a flat metal sheet having disposed on one side thereof a guide pin 100, proximate to the left side 24 and, on the other side thereof, a protrusion 102. The guide pin 100 is operable to be disposed within the guide slot 84 and the protrusion 102 is operable to fit within each of the slots 86 on the right side 26. The gears 80 are operable to be disposed within a slot 106 that has the rack 78 disposed therein and is proximate to the transparent window 32. Only the left side 24 is illustrated. The gears 80 are connected together through a shaft 108, the gears 80 fixedly attached to the shaft 108. In this manner, both gears 80 on either end of the shaft 108 are co-rotatable. The compression panel 38 is slidingly engaged with the shaft 108, such that it can slide in either direction and pivot about the shaft 108. A spring 110 is disposed between the edge of the compression panel 38 and the gear 80 proximate to the left side 24, such that the panel 38 is urged away from the guide slot 84.
In order to move the panel 38, the panel 38 is urged toward the slot 84, such that the guide pin 100 will be inserted in the slot 84. As this happens, the protrusion 102 is moved away from the right side 26 and the slots 86, thus allowing the panel 38 to be urged along the length of the cassette. When the panel 38 is at the appropriate position, the panel 38 is allowed to be moved away from the left side 24 and toward the right side 26 by the spring 110, such that the protrusion 102 will be inserted into one of the slots 86. Typically, this requires some manual manipulation.
The purpose for the fixed configuration of the shaft 108 and the two gears 80 is to prevent the panel 38 from skewing relative to a perpendicular orientation along the path of travel. Therefore, when the panel 38 is urged along the length of the cassette 20, both gears 80 must rotate and maintain a perpendicular orientation.
Referring now to FIG. 8, there is illustrated a detail of the open end showing the door 30 in an open position. The door 30 has associated with the left side a pan head pin 98 for interfacing with the slot 90. The door 30 is operable to rotate about hinges 112, which hinges 112 are asymmetrical, i.e., they are not round. This allows the door 30 to reciprocate in the planar surface thereof. This will allow the door 30 to reciprocate outward away from the pivoting area of the hinges 112, such that the narrow portion of the pan head pins 96 and 98 can insert in the slots 92 and 90, respectively, and then down into the detents 94. On the outermost edge of the door 30, there are provided two slots 114. The slots 114 are operable to interface with corresponding protrusions (not shown) on the docking station.
Referring now to FIG. 9, there is illustrated a side view of the door 30 in a closed position. The door 30 has a recess area 116 on the outer surface thereof which is operable to contain a handle 118. The handle 118 is operable to rotate about a pivot point 120 away from the recess area 116 and extend outward, as illustrated in FIG. 9. This allows the cassette 20 to be picked up. The pivot point 120 is disposed on a vertical protrusion 121 that extends outward from the door 30. A second protrusion 123 is also provided proximate to the end of the door 30 and having a lower height than the protrusion 121. The handle 118 has a pin 125 disposed thereon proximate to the pivot point 120 and slightly outward therefrom. The pin 125 is operable to fit within a recess 127 when the door 30 is closed. When the handle 118 is swung outward from the recess 116, the pin 125 contacts the upper surface of the recess 127 and forces the door 30 downward, such that the pin 98 is forced down into the detent 94. The two perpendicular protrusions 121 and 123 on the surface of the door 30 with the end of the door 28 (not shown) provide an overlap. The protrusions 121 and 123 prevent a would-be thief from slipping a note around the interface between the door 30 and the door 28.
Referring now to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a detail of the feeder docking station. At the feeder docking station, the cassette 20 is disposed in the cassette region 50 just below the buffer region 48. As noted above, the buffer region 48 is approximately equal to the length of the cassette region 50. The feeder mechanism 58 is comprised of a rod 130 that runs along the length of the feeder docking station. A reciprocating device 132 is disposed on the rod 130 and is attached to the paddle 56. The paddle 56 is operable to extend up over the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The reciprocating device 132 is interfaced with a chain 136, the chain constituting a part of the chain drive which is driven by a chain drive mechanism 138 on one end, the upper end, and a pulley mechanism 140 at the opposite end. The chain 136 moves in one direction. The reciprocating mechanism 132 has a release lever associated therewith (not shown) to allow it to be released. This is conventional in a sorter mechanism. Therefore, the reciprocating device 132 can be manually pulled down to a position beneath a group of notes 142.
As noted above, the cassette 20 is disposed in the feeder docking station after a previous cassette has been in the feeder docking station a sufficient amount of time for the paddle 56 to have been reciprocated upward and out of the cassette 20. When the new cassette 20 is disposed in the docking station, the end thereof is interfaced with a plurality of keys 146 that interface with the key slots 74 and 76. Once in the feeder docking station, the door 28 can be opened and door 30 then swiveled outward from the open end. At this point, the paddle 56 is at a location that is higher in the feeder docking station than the open end of the cassette 20. Since a typical cassette holds approximately 2,000 notes, there will be approximately 2,000 notes in the buffer region 48 when a cassette 20 is removed. At a feed rate of 1,500 notes per minute, it requires that a new cassette be disposed in the feeder docking station within less than approximately 1.5 minutes. Since the paddle 56 is reciprocating upward, the notes in the cassette 20 must be urged upward to contact the notes in the buffer region 50 and then the paddle 56 disposed behind the combined groups of notes. This can be done by two methods. In the first method, the user can push the notes in the buffer region upward to maintain a constant pressure thereon and then tilt the paddle 56 by rotating it after releasing it from the chain drive and then sliding it down the rod 130 to a point behind the notes in the cassette 20. The paddle 56 can then be utilized to slide the notes upward until they contact the notes in the buffer region 50, at which time the paddle 56 is then re-engaged with the chain drive. A second method is to urge the notes in the cassette upward from the cassette 20 to contact the back of the paddle 56, this being a manual operation. Thereafter, the user can hold these notes in place, rotate the paddle 56 upward and then place it behind the combined notes in the cassette and the ones previously in the buffer region 48. Thereafter, the operator waits for the notes to be urged completely out of the cassette 20 and then a new cassette placed in the feeder docking station. This is therefore a continuous and seamless operation to the sorter. In order to insure that the operation is continuous, the drive mechanism 138 provides a constant pressure on the notes. This is facilitated through the use of a pressure switch (not shown), which prevents too much pressure being placed on the notes with the paddle 56 or a direct drive motor. Either method is acceptable.
In order to facilitate removal of the cassette 20, a removal lever 150 is provided having an actuating arm 152. The actuating arm 152 is operable to be actuated and to cause the door 30 (not shown) to be urged upward, allowing the user to then complete door closing.
Referring now to FIG. 11, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 disposed in the collection docking station. The collection docking station is substantially similar to the feeder docking station, with the exception that it operates in the reverse end that it does not have as large a buffer region. The buffer region is approximately 6 inches, less than the length of a cassette 20. In this mechanism, the paddle 68 is reciprocated along a rod (not shown) similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. A reciprocating block 154 is provided which is operable to reciprocate along this rod (not shown). The reciprocating block 154 is interfaced with an engaging member that contacts the side of a toothed belt 156, the toothed belt 156 being disposed on an idler pulley 158, that is toothed, and to a toothed drive pulley 160 on the other end. Drive pulley 160 is driven by a belt drive motor 164. The blade 68 is operable to reciprocate upward a sufficient vertical distance to clear notes 168 that are disposed in the collection docking station. The paddle 68 can then be disengaged with the belt 56 and reciprocated to a desired position.
The operation is such that notes, after the sorting operation, are routed to the particular collection docking station in which the cassette 20 resides and are, via gravity, disposed therein. The surface of the collection docking station is at approximately a forty five degree angle. When the paddle is reciprocated up to the closest position to the sorting mechanism, the notes will be disposed in the sorter and, in response to notes coming into the particular collection docking station, the belt drive motor 164 will increment the belt 156 and reciprocate the paddle 68 down toward the lower end of the collection docking station, which is also the closed end of the cassette 20, when the cassette 20 is disposed in the collection docking station. As will be described hereinbelow, there are sensors that sense when the paddle 68 approaches the cassette 20 and, a switch associated with the cassette 20 being in place will be sensed. If this switch is set, indicating a cassette 20 is disposed therein, the operation will continue and the blade 68 will move downward. Once a sufficient number of notes to fill the capacity of the cassette 20 have been disposed at a particular collection station, the paddle 68 will then be moved downward in the cassette 20, the paddle 68 reciprocated vertically upward and then moved all the way to the top, such that new notes coming into the collection docking station can then be disposed on the upper surface of the paddle 68. The cassette 20 can then have the door thereof closed, and then removed from the collection docking station. A new empty cassette is then disposed therein. Typically, as described above, the cassette 20 is already open. However, the locking keys (not shown) are disposed on the collection docking station to allow the cassette 20 be in an unlocked position and thereafter allow the door 28 to be slidingly moved upward for closure.
Referring now to FIG. 12, there is illustrated a side view of the paddle 68 and the reciprocating member 154. The paddle 68 has a lower flat surface 170, which contacts the notes 168. An extending arm 172 extends upward over the right side 24 of the cassette 20 and downward to a vertically reciprocating arm 174. The vertically reciprocating arm 174 reciprocates within a slide bracket 176. Slide bracket 176 is attached to the reciprocating member 154, reciprocating member 154 having a cylindrical bore 178 disposed therethrough that is operable to reciprocate along the rod that was not shown in FIG. 11 and that is similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. Below the reciprocating member 178 is disposed a toothed block 180, toothed block 180 shown in a side view and operable to interface with the teeth on the inside surface of the belt 156 on the outer band. Whenever it is desired to release the toothed block 180 from the belt 156, it is only necessary to pull up on the arm 172 which will rotate the toothed block 180 away from the surface of the belt 156.
Referring now to FIG. 13, there is illustrated a top view of the collection docking station with the cassette 20 removed. The collection docking station has a flat plate 182 with sides 184 and 186 associated therewith, these providing a guide for the cassette 20 on either side thereof A door 184 is provided, which is substantially identical to the door 22 on the desktop docking station 16 in FIG. 2. This door 184 covers the key members 146 described above with respect to FIG. 10 and is operable to open in response to the cassette 20 being placed therein. The purpose of the door 184, as described above, is for protection and, also for a visual view to require the user to place the cassette above the door and then slide it down to open the door and insert the keys. Otherwise, the user might try to push down upon the keys 146, thus damaging the keys 146. A switch orifice 190 is provided for containing a switch 192, which switch 192 indicates the presence of the cassette 20 when the door 30 is opened. The door 30 is operable to open into a space 194 which has a plate 196 disposed on the upper end thereof. This plate 196 is raised and has two projections 198 and 200 which are operable to interface with the slots 114 and the door 30, as illustrated in FIG. 8. Therefore, the door 30 can be laid flat such that a flat surface is presented. The release lever device 150, described above with respect to FIG. 10, is disposed on the upper left side of the cassette 20 when disposed therein. An extending lever member 204 extends outward in front of the cassette 20 when installed and under the edge of the door 30, substantially under the pan head pin 98. Therefore, it is only necessary to actuate the lever 152 to raise the lever member 204 and pull the door 30 upward to allow the user to grasp this lever.
A sensor 206 is provided in the side of the buffer region 60 which is operable to sense the presence of notes on the surface of the paddle 68. The paddle 68 is reciprocated all the way up to the sorter such that it is past the sensor 206. The sensor will indicate that there are no notes past that point. Once the notes have been collected to a certain thickness, the paddle 68 will reciprocate past the sensor 206 and the sensor 206 will provide a signal to a central control system. The central control system will then determine if the switch 192 is depressed, indicating the presence of a cassette. If not, then the system will be shut down only when the paddle is not in the buffer region. If it is in the buffer region, it will continue to operate.
Referring now to FIG. 14, there is illustrated a top view of the closed end 72 of the cassette 20, illustrating the locking mechanism. A first shaft 210 extends between the left side 24 and right side 26 and has associated therewith on one side two pivoting lever members 212 and 214. On the opposite side, proximate to the right side 26, are disposed two similar pivoting lever members 216 and 218. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are separated by a plastic bushing 220 attached to the shaft 210 with springs 222 and 224 disposed between the block 220 and pivoting lever members 212 and 214, respectively. Similarly, a plastic block 226 is disposed between pivoting lever members 216 and 218 and separated therefrom by springs 228 and 230. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are disposed above the outside key access holes 74 on the left side of the end 72 and the two pivoting members 216 and 218 are each disposed against opposite ones of the outside holes on the key access hole 76. The key members 146 are comprised of two outside key members 231 and 232 and a central key member 236. The outside key members 231 and 232 of the key portion associated with the key access holes 74 are operable to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, on the key member 146 associated with the key access hole 76, the outer key members 231 and 232 are operable to pass through the outside key access holes 76 to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 216 and 218.
A second shaft 240 is provided that is disposed between the left side 24 and the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The shaft 240 is closer to the end 72. A pivoting lever 242 is disposed on the shaft 240 to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, a pivoting lever 244 is disposed on the shaft 240 and allowed to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever member 216 and 218. Disposed on each side of the pivoting members 242 are tracks (not shown}. These tracks are operable to receive pins 246 that extend outward from the associated pivoting members 212 and 214, or 216 and 218. This will be described in more in detail with respect to FIG. 15. The pivoting lever members 242 are urged upward with the center key members 236 in each of the key devices 146. As will be described hereinbelow, when the pivoting lever 242 is urged upward, it is necessary for the pivoting action of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214, and 216 and 216 to traverse the path such that the pins 246 disposed in the ends and extending outward therefrom will traverse a particular path. Therefore, there is a defined shape to each of the members 231 and 232 which will determine this path.
Referring now to FIG. 15, there is illustrated a side view of a locking member looking into the side of the right side 26. There is provided a locking lever 250, which is pivoted on one end at a pivot point 252 and has a "crook" 254 on the other end thereof, this crook being at a distance from the pivot point 252, such that the crook 252 will pivot into the path 70. Whenever the door 28 slides through the guide 70 into the crook 254, the locking lever 250 rotated such that the crook 254 is in that path, this will prevent further movement. Additionally, once the door 28 is urged against the crook 254, the direction of forces is "normal" to the pivot point 252, such that the lever 250 is not stressed, the force being along the length thereof.
The lever member 244 extends outward from the shaft 240 and has a pivoting shaft 256 disposed thereon, which is pivoted about a hole in the distal end of the locking lever 250, distal from the pivoting point 252. Whenever the lever 244 is urged upward by the locking pin 234, the pivoting shaft 256 will be urged upward, pivoting the locking lever 250 about the pivot point 252 and moving the crook 254 away from the path 70, to thereby allow the door 28 to pass thereby.
The pivoting lever 244 has a track 260 formed in the side thereof that is operable to interface with the pin 246 in the lever 216. An opposite path is disposed on the opposite side to interface with the pin 246 in the pivoting lever 218. This path 260 is configured such that, as lever 244 pivots upward, the end of the pivoting lever 216 must pivot in such a manner that the pin 246 will meander along the correct path. If the shape of the key member 231 is not correct, the path will be wrong and it will fall into defined "pockets" which will prevent further movement and further pivoting of lever 244. The shape of both key members 231 and 232 must be correct in order to insure that the end of the pivoting members 216 and 218 traverse the defined path.
In summary, there has been provided a currency sorting system utilizing a cassette for transporting the currency between locations. The cassette is a secured device that has an interior with a door that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the currency and an end that allows currency to be reciprocated out in a push operation. The cassette has a locking device for engaging with a corresponding key on a docking station, such that when the cassette is disposed on the docking station, the door will open. When removed from the docking station, and the door is closed, the door cannot be opened. The cassette is hand loaded at one docking station and then secured for movement to a second docking station that is associated with a sorting mechanism. On the sorting mechanism, it is necessary to feed the notes into the sorter input. The feeding docking station is approximately twice the length of the cassette with a cassette region and a buffer region. A paddle is utilized to extend downward into the cassette to urge the notes up into the buffer region. Once the notes are in the buffer region, the cassette can be removed and another cassette disposed therein and the paddle again moved into the cassette to urge the notes outward in a continuous motion. When the cassette is removed, it is then disposed in a third collection docking station in a collection slot. The collection slot is associated with a sorter output wherein notes that are sorted are disposed in particular ones of the collection docking stations. A paddle is provided in this station that reciprocates downward into the cassette as notes are disposed in that particular docking station. When the cassette is full, it can then be removed.
Although the preferred embodiment has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

The user has requested enhancement of the downloaded file. CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO ENGINEERING CALCULATIONS 1.1 Introduction What do chemical engineers do? Although their backgrounds and professional skills are similar, chemical engineers work in a wide variety of industries, in addition to chemicals and petroleum, such as: Biotechnology Lime and cement Consulting Man-made fibers Drugs and pharmaceuticals Metallurgical and metal products Fats and oils Paints, varnishes, and pigments Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals Pesticides and herbicides Environment Waste water treatment All the industries as mentioned above are involving numerous of chemical process unit. Therefore, chemical engineers play an important role on design, operation, control, troubleshooting, research and management in the chemical process. Chemical process is a combination of process equipment designed to efficiently convert raw materials into finished or intermediate products. Figure 1 shows the example of chemical processes converting the raw material into desired product. Figure 1.1: Chemical process 1.2 Units and Dimensions “What are units and dimensions and how do they differ?” Dimensions are basic concepts of measurement such as length (L), mass (M), time (t), temperature (T), amount of substance (n) and so on. Besides, units are the mean of expressing the dimensions as feet or centimeters for length, or hours or seconds for time. By attaching units to all numbers that are not fundamentally dimensionless, you are able to easy interrelating the physical meaning to the numbers use. Moreover, a logical 1 approach to the problem rather than remembering a formula and plugging numbers could also help the chemical engineers in engineering calculation. SI units are universally accepted for engineering calculation. Thus, American engineering system (based on British standards) is still used extensively in the U.S. Example 1.1 What are the dimensions of mass flux (mass flow rate per unit area perpendicular to the flow)? G A dm dt = 1 L t M 2 dimensions are The rules for handling units are essentially quite simple by addition, subtraction or equality. ¾ Values could be added if UNITS are the same. ¾ Values cannot be added if DIMENSIONS are different. Example 1.2 (i) 6 ft + 10 0 C =??? * Different dimensions: length, temperature -- cannot be added * Same dimension: length, different units -- can add 2 Table 1.1: SI Units Physical Quantity Name of Unit Symbol for Unit* Definition of Unit Basic SI Units Length metre, meter m Mass kilogramme, kilogram kg Time second s Temperature kelvin K Amount of substance mole mol Derived Sl Units Energy joule J kg.m2 .s -2 Force newton N kg.m.s-2 = J.m-1 Power watt W kg.m2 .s-3 = J.s-1 Density kilogram per cubic meter kg.m-3 Velocity meter per second rn.s -1 Acceleration meter per second squared rn.s-2 Pressure newton per square meter, pascal N.m-2, Pa Heat Capacity joule per (kilogram - kelvin) J.kg-1 ,K-1 Alternative Units Time minute, hour, day, year min, h, d, y Temperature degree Celsius °C Mass tonne, ton (Mg), gram t, g Volume litre, liter (dm3 ) L Table 1.2: American Engineering System Units Physical Quantity Name of Unit Symbol Basic Units Length feet ft Mass pound (mass) lbm Force pound (force) lbf Time second, hour s, hr Temperature degree Rankine °R Derived Units Energy British thermal unit, foot pound (force) Btu, (ft)(lbf) Power horsepower hp Density pound (mass) per cubic foot lbm/ft3 Velocity feet per second ft/s Acceleration feet per second squared ft/s2 Pressure pound (force) per square inch lbf/in2 Heat capacity Btu per pound (mass) per degree F Btu/lbm. 0 F 3 1.3 Conversion of Units Conversion factors are statements of equivalent values of different units in the same system or between systems of units. The concept is to multiply any number and its associated units with dimensionless ratios termed conversion factors to arrive at desired answer and its associated units. The factors for conversion units are show in table 1.3.

The atomic weights of all the elements in their naturally isotopic proportions are listed in the table given. The molecular weight of a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms that constitute a molecule of the compound: For example atomic oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16 and therefore molecular oxygen (O2) has a molecular weight of approximately 32. A gram-mole (g-mole or mol in SI units) of a 9 species is the amount of that species whose mass in grams is numerically equal to its molecular weight.

They are almost always prerequisite to all other calculations in the solution of process engineering problems. Material balances are nothing more than the application of the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed. Thus, as an example, you cannot specify an input to a reactor of one ton of naphtha and an output of two tons of gasoline or gases or anything else. One ton of total material in o A material balance is an accounting for material. Thus, material balances are often compared to the balancing of current accounts.

The internal energy of a system depends almost entirely on the chemical composition, state of aggregation (solid, liquid, or gas), and temperature of the system materials. If no temperature chemical reactions occur in a closed system and if pressure changes are less than a few atmospheres, then ∆ ≈ U 0. 2. If a system is not accelerating, then ∆ EK = 0. If a system is not rising or falling, then ∆ EP = 0. 3. If a system and its surroundings are at the same temperature or the system is perfectly insulated, then Q = 0. The process is then termed adiabatic. 4. Work done on or by a closed system is accomplished by movement of the system boundary against a resisting force or the passage of an electrical current or radiation across the system boundary. If there no moving parts or electrical current at the system boundary, then W = 0. en System is done on the surrounding by mass that emerges from the systems. ` Both work terms must be include in the energy balance for open system. 3.7 Energy Balances on Op ` In open system, mass is transferred across the system boundaries while the process is taking place. ` Therefore work must be done on open system to push mass in and work 38 ` he net ork d y an open system; process fluid on a moving part within the d at the system outlet minus rate of ol is used to denote the specific property (property divided by mass or by T w one b where; & - shaft work (rate of work done by the WS system such as a pump rotor.) & - flow work (rate of work done by the flui Wfl work done by the fluid at the system inlet.) ` ^ symb mole) such as specific internal energy (U ) kJ/kg), specific volume ( V ) m3 /kg) and so on. ` ne important property for energy balance on open system is specific enthalpy ( O Hˆ kJ/kg). ` Sometimes, universal gas law constant can be used as a conversion factor to cific enthalpy. of helium at this temperature and pressure, and the rate at which enthalpy is ansported by a stream of helium at 300 K and 1 atm with a molar flowrate of 250 Solution: o convert L.atm/mol into J/mol, we need the factor J/(L.atm).

The phase diagram shows, in pressure-temperature space, 41 the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas. The phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the critical point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable, in what is known as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around Tc=647.096 K (1,164.773 °R), pc=22.064 MPa (3,200.1 psi) and ρc=356 kg/m³.

H phenol Δ ˆ = (vapor, 300˚C, 3 atm) – (solid, 25˚C, 1 atm) o Cannot determine directly from enthalpy table – must use hypothetical process path consist of several step. o Check Table of Physical Properties Data Appendix 5: P= 1 atm; Tm= 42.5°C and Tb= 181.4°C 46 1 2 3 4 5 6 Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ=Δ HHHHHHH ˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ 4.3 Procedure Energy Balance Calculations 1. Perform all required material balance calculations. 2. Write the appropriate form of the energy balance (closed or open system) and delete any of the terms that are either zero or negligible for the given process system. 3. Choose a reference state – phase, temperature, and pressure – for each species involved in the process. 4. Construct inlet-outlet table for specific internal energy (close system) or specific enthalpy (close system) { For closed system, construct a Table with columns for initial and final amounts of each species (mi or ni) and specific internal energies (Uˆ ) relative to the chosen reference states. { For an open system, construct a table with columns for inlet and outlet stream component flow rates (mi or ni) and specific enthalpies ( Hˆ ) relative to the chosen references states. 5. Calculate all required values of Hˆ or Uˆ and insert the values in the appropriate places in the table. Then calculate Δ Hˆ or ΔUˆ for the system. 6. Calculate any work, kinetic energy, or potential energy terms that you have not dropped from the energy balance. 7. Solve the energy balance for whichever variable is unknown (often Q). 47 Example of Inlet-Outlet Enthalpy Table: References: Ac (liquid, 20˚C, 5atm); N2 (gas, 25˚C, 1atm) Substance Inlet Outlet nin & Hin ˆ nout & Hout ˆ Ac (vapor) 66.9 3.35 Ac (l) - - 63.55 0 N2 33.1 33.1 4.4 Change in Pressure (P) at Constant Temperature (T) & Constant Phase ` Solid & Liquid o Nearly independent of pressure.

Heat transfer is thermal energy in transit due to a temperature difference. In other words, heat transfer is to predict the energy transfer between material bodies. [In the simplest of terms, the discipline of heat transfer is concerned with only two things: temperature, and the flow of heat. Temperature represents the amount of thermal energy available, whereas heat flow represents the movement of thermal energy from place to place.] o How Science of heat transfer explain: ¾ How heat energy may be transfer? ¾ Predict the rate at which the exchange will take place? ¾ Different between thermodynamics and heat transfer ? o Thermodynamics deal with system in equilibrium, it may used to predict of energy required to change a system from one equilibrium state to another. But it does not predict how fast a change will take place. Example 6.1 Consider the cooling of a hot steel bar which is placed in a pail of water. Thermodynamics may used to predict the final equilibrium temperature of steel bar-water combination. However, thermodynamics will not tell: ¾ how long to reach the equilibrium or, ¾ what the temperature of steel bar after certain length of time? 67 Table 6.1: Comparison between heat transfer and thermodynamics HEAT TRANSFER THERMODYNAMICS • Heat transfer is a study which predicts the energy transfer which takes place between material bodies. • It is due to the temperature difference • Heat transfer explains how heat energy may be transferred. • It also predicts the rate at which the exchange will take place under certain condition. • Thermodynamics deals with systems in equilibrium. • Thermodynamics may used to predict the amount of energy required to change a system from one equilibrium state to another. • Thermodynamics may not used to predict how fast a change will take place since the system is not in equilibrium during the process. Three modes of heat transfer are: (1) Conduction (2) Convection (3) Radiation 6.2 Conduction Heat Transfer o Energy transfer from high temperature region to low temperature region. We said that the energy is transferred by conduction. And, the heat transfer rate per unit area is proportional to the normal temperature gradient. q/A ~ dT/dx where, q/A = heat transfer rate (W/m2 ) dT/dx = temperature gradient in the direction of the heat flow When proportionality constant is inserted, q = - kA dT/dx [6.1] o The positive constant k = thermal conductivity of the material. The minus (-) sign is inserted so that the second principle of thermodynamics will be satisfied i.e. heat must flow downhill on the temperature scale as indicated in Figure 6.1. 68 Equation (8.0) is called Fourier’s Law of heat conduction. Above is defining equation for the thermal conductivity and k has the unit of Watts per meter per Celsius degree (W/m.0 C), which the heat flow is expressed in watts. Figure 6.1: Sketch showing direction of heat flow Table 6.2: Lists typical values of the thermal conductivities of some metal (thermal conductivity at 300 K(W/m K)). Metal k Copper, pure 396 Aluminium 238 Carbon steel, 1% C 42 Plastics 0.2 - 0.3 Air 0.026 69 Figure 6.2: One –dimensional plane wall o Consider the one-dimensional plane wall shown in Figure above, if the system in a steady state, i.e., if the temperature does not change with time, then only integrate Equation (8.0) and substitute the appropriate values. 1 0 2 x T T q dx kdT A = ∫ ∫ o Where temperature at the left face (x=0) is uniform at T1 and the temperature at right face is uniform at T2. If k is independent of T, we obtain after integration : 2 q T T 1 k A L − = − o Under the steady state conditions, where the distribution is linear, the temperature gradient may be expressed as: T T 2 1 dT dx L − = o And the heat transfer rate: T T 2 1 q k A L − = − or; T T 1 2 q T k k A L L − Δ = = 70 o Since dT/dx = - q/k for the same q, if k is low (i.e: for an insulator), dT/dx will be large .i.e. there will be a large temperature difference across the wall, and if k is high (i.e. for a conductor), dT/dx will be small, or there will be a small temperature difference across the wall. Example 6.2 One face of a copper plate 3 cm thick is maintained at 400 °C, and the other face maintained at 100 °C. How much heat is transferred through the plate? Given: k = 370 W/m.K. From Fourier’s Law, q d k A d = − T x Integrating gives ( ) 2 370 / . (100 400) 3 10 q T W mK K k A x m− Δ − − =− = Δ × q/A = 3.7 MW/m 2 6.3 Convection Heat Transfer o It is well known that hot plate of metal will cool faster when placed in front of a fan than when exposed to still air. We say that, heat is convected away, and we call the process, convection heat transfer. The velocity at which the air blows over the hot plate obviously influence the heat transfer rate. 6.3.1 Mechanism of convection o Consider the heated plate shown on Figure 8.3. Temperature of plate is Tw and temperature of the fluid is T∞. The velocity of the flow will appear as shown in the figure. 71 Figure 6.3: Convection heat transfer from a plate o The velocity is being reduced to zero at the plate as a result of viscous action. Since the velocity of fluid layer at the wall will be zero, the heat must be transferred only by conduction. Thus we might compute the heat transfer, using: q = -kA (dT/dx) but with little changes. We use thermal conductivity of fluid and the fluid temperature gradient at the wall.The temperature gradient is dependent on the rate at which the fluid carries the heat away. High velocity produces a large temperature gradient. Thus, the temperature gradient at the wall depends on the flow field. To express the overall effect of convection, we use Newton’s law of cooling: q = hA (Tw-T∞) [6.2] where, h = convection heat-transfer coefficient (heat-transfer coefficient = film conductance) h = watt per square meter per Celsius degree (W/m² .°C) when the heat flow is in Watt. o Heat-transfer rate is related to overall temperature difference between the wall and fluid and the surface area. 6.3.2 Free and Forced Convection o If heated plate were exposed to ambient room air without an external source of motion, a movement of the air would be experienced as a result of the density gradients near the plate. o We call this as free convection. When the mass motion of the fluid is caused by an external device like a pump, compressor, blower or fan, the process is called forced convection. Example 6.3 72 Air at 20 °C blows over a hot plate 50 by 75 cm maintained at 250 °C. The convection heat transfer coefficient is 25 W/m².°C. Calculate the heat transfer? Solution: From Newton’s Law of cooling; ( ) w q hA T T = − ∞ q = (25)W/m2 .K (0.5x0.75) m2 (250-20)K q = 2.156 kW Example 6.4 An electric current is passed through a wire 1 mm in diameter and 10 cm long. The wire is submerged in liquid water at atmospheric pressure, and the current is increased until the water boils. For this situation h = 5000 W/m².°C, and the water temperature will be 100 °C. How much electric power must be supplied to the wire to maintain the wire surface at 114 °C. Solution: Total convection loss is ( ) w q hA T T = − ∞ The surface area of the wire A = πdL = π (1x10 -3 )(10x10 -2 ) = 3.142 x 10 -4 m 2 Therefore, the heat transfer is q = (5000w/m².°C)(3.142 x 10 -4 m²)(114-100) = 21.99 W and this is equal to the electric power which must be applied. 6.4 Radiation Heat Transfer o Heat may also transfer through regions where perfect vacuum exist. The mechanism in this case is electromagnetic radiation which is propagated as a result of a temperature difference. This is called thermal radiation. o This is confirmed by our experienced everyday experience of being warmed by the sun, which separated from the earth by approximately 1.5 x 1011 m of empty space. o Thermal radiation can of course transport through any ‘transparent’ medium such as air. Ideal thermal radiator, or black body, will emit energy at a rate 73 q emitted = σAT4 [6.3] where; σ is the proportionality constant and is called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant with value of 5.669 x 10 -8 W/m 2 .K 4 . o This equation is called Stefan-Boltzmann law of thermal radiation and it apply to only blackbodies. This equation is valid only for thermal radiation; other type of electromagnetic radiation may not be treated so simply. q emitted = σAT4 govern only radiation emitted by a blackbody. The net radian exchange between two surface will be proportional to the difference in absolute temperature to the fourth power. i.e: q net exchange/ A  (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) q net exchange/ A = σ (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) 6.4.1 Blackbody o It is a perfect emitter of radiation. At a particular temperature the blackbody would emit the maximum amount of energy possible for that temperature. o This value is known as the blackbody radiation. It would emit at every wavelength of light as it must be able to absorb every wavelength to be sure of absorbing all incoming radiation. o The maximum wavelength emitted by a blackbody radiator is infinite. It also emits a definite amount of energy at each wavelength for a particular temperature, so standard black body radiation curves can be drawn for each temperature, showing the energy radiated at each wavelength (Fig. 6.4). 74 Figure 6.4: Theoretical black body curve for 5000K o Again, blackbody is a body which radiates energy according to the T 4 law. Other type of surface, such as glossy painted surface or a polished metal plate, do not radiate as much energy as the blackbody. o However, the total radiation emitted by this body still generally follows the T1 4 proportionality. To take account of the “gray” nature of such surfaces we introduce another factor, called the emissivity,  which relates the radiation of the “gray” surface to that of an ideal black surface. In addition, we must take into account the fact that not all the radiation leaving one surface will reach the other surface since electromagnetic radiation travels in straight line and some will lost to the surrounding. o Therefore two new factors in (Eq 8.2)take into account both situation, so that q= F F G σ A (T1 4 - T 2 4 ) [6.4] F = emissivity function F G = geometric “view factor” function A simple radiation problem is encounter when we have a heat-transfer surface at temperature T1 completely enclosed by much larger surface maintained at T2. The net radiant exchange in this case can be calculated with, q =  1 Aσ 1 (T 4 1 - T 4 2 ) where,  1 = emissivity of material Example 6.5 Two infinite black plates at 800 0 C and 300 0 C exchange heat by radiation. Calculate the heat transfer per unit area. Given: σ = 5.669 x 10 -8 W/m 2 .K 4 Solution: q/A = σ (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) = 5.669 X 10 -8 )W/m 2 .K 4 (10734 - 5734)K 4 = 69.03 kW/m 2 75 Problems 1. If 3 kW is conducted through a section of insulating material 0.6 m2 in crosssection and 2.5 cm thick and the thermal conductivity may be taken as 0.2 W/m0 C, compute the temperature difference across the material. 2. A temperature difference of 850 C is impressed across a fiberglass layer of 13 cm thickness. The thermal conductivity of the fiberglass is 0.035 W/m.0 C. Compute the heat transferred through the material per hour per unit area. 3. Two perfectly black surfaces are constructed so that all the radiant energy leaving a surface at 8000 C reaches the other surface. The temperature of the other surface is maintained at 2500 C. Calculate the heat transfer between the surfaces per hour and per unit area of the surface maintained at 8000 C. 4. One side of a plane wall is maintained at 100 C, while the other side is exposed to a convection having T = 100 C and h=10 W/m2.0 C. The wall has k = 1.6 W/m.0 C and is 40 cm thick. Calculate the heat transfer rate through the wall. 0 5. A vertical square plate, 30cm on a side, is maintained at 500 C and exposed to room air at 200 C. The surface emissivity is 0.8. Calculate the total heat lost by both sides of the plate. CHAPTER 7 HEAT EXCHANGERS 7.1 Introduction A heat exchanger is a device that facilitates exchange of heat between two fluids that are at different temperatures and separated by a solid wall. In other words, heat exchangers are devices built for efficient heat transfer from one fluid to another and are widely used in engineering processes. The specific applications of heat exchanger are space heating and air conditioning, power production, waste heat recovery, food and chemical processing, oil refining, and in vehicles. 76 7.2 Heat exchanger types Heat exchangers are classified according to flow arrangement and type of construction. Six (6) types of heat exchanger are: (a) Concentric Tube Heat Exchangers (b) Cross-Flow Heat Exchangers (c) Cross-counter Flow (Coil) Heat Exchangers (d) Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers (e) Compact Heat Exchangers (f) Plate-Type Heat Exchangers (a) Concentric Tube Heat Exchanger ƒ It also called double-pipe heat exchangers or co-axial flow heat exchangers [Figure 7.1]. ƒ One fluid flows inside the tube and the other fluid flows inside the annulus. ƒ In parallel-flow heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end, and travel in parallel to exit at the other side. [Figure7.2a] ƒ In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. Counter current design is more efficient, in that it can transfer more heat [Figure 7.2b]. Figure 7.1: Concentric tube heat exchangers (a) Parallel flow (b) Counterflow Figure 7.2: Concentric tube heat exchangers 77 (b) Cross Flow Heat Exchanger ƒ In a cross-flow heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger. ƒ In finned tubular heat exchangers, the fin-side fluid is unmixed because the fins confine the flow to one direction. Example: automobile radiator. ƒ In unfinned tubular heat exchangers, the fin-side fluid is mixed because the flow in transverse direction is possible. [Figure 7.3] ƒ The use of fins to improve the convection coefficient of fin-side fluid by increasing the outside surface area.

One fluid flows inside the tubes and the other flows inside the shell. ƒ Figure 8.5, show the simplest form of shell and tube heat exchanger which involves single tube and shell passes. ƒ Figure 7.5: Shell and tube heat exchanger with one-shell pass one-tube pass (1-1) (a) Two-pass (b) Four-pass (cross-counterflow mode of operation) ƒ Baffles are usually installed to increase the convection coefficient of the shell-side fluid by inducing turbulence and a cross-flow velocity component. 79 ƒ Baffled heat exchanger with one shell pass and two tube passes and with two shell passes and four tube passes are shown in Figures 7.6a and 7.6b, respectively. Figure 7.6: Shell-and-tube heat exchanger. (a) One shell pass and two tube passes. (b) Two shell passes and four tube passes ƒ Shell-and-tube heat exchangers are classified according to the number of shell and tube passes involved. ƒ Heat exchangers in which all the tubes make one U-turn in the shell, for example, are called one-shell-pass and two-tube-passes heat exchangers. ƒ Heat exchanger that involves two passes in the shell and four passes in the tubes is called a two-shell-passes and four-tube-passes heat exchanger [Figure 7.7] 80 (a) One-shell pass and two-tube passes (b) Two-shell passes and four-tube passes Figure 7.7: Multipass flow arrangement in shell-and-tube heat exchangers (e) Compact Heat Exchanger ƒ Used to achieve very large heat transfer area per unit volume. ƒ Have dense arrays of finned tubes or plates. ƒ Typically used when at least one of the fluids is a gas, characterized by small convection coefficient. ƒ The tubes may be flat or circular, and the fins may be plate or circular (Figure 7.8a, 7.8b and 7.8c). ƒ Parallel plates may be finned or corrugated and may be used in single-pass or multi-pass mode (Figure 7.8d and 7.8e). 81 Figure 7.8: Compact heat exchanger cores.

Cassette based document handling system
Abstract
A cassette (20) for a currency handling system includes a door (28) that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the cassette. An end door (30) is operable to be opened to allow currency that is disposed within the interior of the cassette (20) to be urged outward. The cassette (20) has a locking mechanism disposed in an end (72), which locking mechanism prevents the door from opening until the cassette (20) is disposed in a docking station. Once in the docking station, a paddle (56) is urged downward into the cassette (20) to urge the notes outward therefrom. These notes are moved into a buffer region (58) and then the cassette (20) can be removed to allow another cassette (20) to be disposed therein. This allows a continuous feeding operation. The cassette (20) can then be disposed in a second collection docking station to collect the output of the sorter (41). In this docking station, a paddle (68) is reciprocated downward into the cassette (20) with the collected notes.

Description
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention pertains in general to a document handling system and, more particularly, to a currency handling system that utilizes a cassette for transporting currency between stations.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
After currency is distributed in the public sector, it will typically find its way back into the banking institutions. This is facilitated through individuals depositing currency documents in their local banking institutions, and businesses forwarding their cash receipts to the banking institutions. Once the banking institutions have received the currency in the form of the notes, these notes must then be processed. Although the processing can be facilitated by hand, this is somewhat tedious. To facilitate the large number of notes that must be sorted, counted and then re-bundled or "strapped" for distribution back to the banks, large high speed currency sorting machines have been developed.
Currency sorting machines typically have a feeder slot into which stacks of currency in different denominations and even different sizes can be placed. The currency sorter will then individually strip the notes or documents from the feeder slot, pass them through various sensing stations to determine the denomination of the note and even the quality or integrity of the note. Once this is done, then the sorting machine will deposit the note in a collection slot associated with the proper denomination. Typically, a separate collection slot is provided for notes that are defective due to, for example, a tear or excessive wear. These sorting machines can sort notes at rates up to 2,000 notes per minute.
The disadvantage to present sorting systems is the manner in which the notes must be transported between stations. Typically, there are three stations, the first being the initial hand sorting or collection operation at the original banking institution, the second being the feeder operation to the sorter and the third being the collection operation at the sorter. Due to the high speed nature of the sorter, the sorter typically outstrips the speed at which the documents can be placed into the sorter and then removed from the sorter. Therefore, there exists a need for a system that will facilitate an increase in the throughput.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention disclosed and claimed herein comprises a method and apparatus for transferring documents utilizing a portable cassette having a cover that can be opened to expose the documents or closed in a secured and locked manner to prevent access to documents contained therein. The cassette is loaded at a first station in an open configuration to provide a stack of documents therein, and, after loading, the cassette is locked. The loaded cassette is then transported to a second location in the locked configuration, and then disposed in an unloading docking station.
The loaded cassette is opened to expose at least one end of the stack, and then the stack of documents in the loaded cassette is urged out of the loaded cassette through the at least one end into a buffer region that is continually moving. This allows the contents of the cassette to become part of the documents in the buffer region. The cassette is removed after urging the documents therefrom and after the documents have cleared the at least one end. The unloading operation is then continuously repeated with a new loaded cassette.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a diagrammatic view of the process flow for a document handling system of the present invention, which utilizes a cassette for transporting currency. The process flow is provided by three stations, a hand load station 10, a feeder station 12 and a collection station 14. Initially, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, currency is hand loaded into a cassette. Typically, the cassettes are delivered to a banking institution in an open configuration, there being a locking system that allows the cassette to be placed into a closed and secure configuration. These cassettes are stacked in a compact manner such that an operator can remove the open cassette from the stack, place it on what is referred to as a "desktop station" and then proceed to load the currency therein. Typically, the currency is counted at the banking institution by hand, placed in some type of bundle and then disposed in the cassette. There may be some type of separator card with a bar code disposed thereon which can be utilized at the central banking institution for identification. Once the currency is hand loaded into the cassette, the cassette is then closed and placed in a secure configuration. Once it is in this configuration, it cannot be opened until it is placed onto another docking station that has a key system for unlocking the cassette.
After the cassettes are hand loaded and secured, they are then placed on some type of transport or given to an individual that has the responsibility for the transport. The loaded cassettes are then transported to a sorting facility. The sorting facility contains both the feeder station 12 and the collection station 14. Of course, the sorting facility may be in the next room from the hand loading station 10. At the feeder station 12, the loaded cassettes can be sequentially disposed in the feeder station to allow high speed feeding and high speed sorting. Further, as will be described hereinbelow, this is a continuous feeding operation.
In the continuous feeding operation, a cassette is retrieved from the transport mechanism or the stack and placed onto a docking station associated with the feeding station 12. When it is placed on the docking station, this action unlocks the cassette and allows the door for the cassette to be opened and providing access to the contents. Once access is obtained, then the operator configures the feeding station to urge the notes out of the cassettes and into a buffer region. Once all the bills are urged out of cassette and into the buffer region, the cassette can then be removed in an open position and then a new loaded and locked cassette placed therein and the procedure continues.
Once the cassette is placed into the feeder station 12, the bills that are accessed are placed behind the previous notes in the buffer region. Therefore, the interior of the cassette and the buffer region constitute a feeding supply to the sorting system. The urging of the notes out of the cassette is the same operation that urges the notes in the buffer region up into interface with the sorting mechanism. This is a constant operation with the notes continually urged upward into the sorting mechanism, such that when a new cassette is placed into the feeding mechanism, the previous notes are still in the buffer region to provide a "seamless" feeding operation. The notes are fed at approximately 1,500 notes per minute and a typical cassette will contain about 2,000 notes.
The sorting mechanism is operable to retrieve the notes from the feeding mechanism, evaluate those notes for the integrity of the notes, orientation and also the denomination of the notes. The notes are then "slotted" into different collection slots. The open cassettes are placed into a docking station in the collection slot, similar to the docking station in the feeder slot, and then the notes collected therein. Once the notes are collected, the cassette can then be locked and removed for subsequent processing.
Referring now to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a block diagram of desktop station 16 for use in the hand loading station 10. The desktop station 16 is a box that has a tilted receiving surface 18. The tilted receiving surface 18 is operable to receive a cassette 20 on the surface thereof The desktop station 16 has at the lower end of the surface 18 a tilting door 22, which door 22 is operable to cover a locking mechanism (not shown). The door 22 is spring loaded, such that when the cassette 20 is removed, the door 22 will swing closed to cover the locking mechanism. This provides both a protective cover and a technique to ensure that the cassette 20 will be placed on the surface 18 above the locking mechanism, such that it will be on the same plane as the locking mechanism before engaging the locking mechanism.
The cassette 20 is comprised of a left side 24 and a right side 26. A tambour door 28 is disposed on the cassette 20, such that it can be pulled over the top opening of the cassette 20. An end door 30 is provided on one end thereof which is operable to cover an end opening. Therefore, the door 28 can be slidingly moved over the top opening and a portion of the end opening and, in conjunction with the door 30, completely seal the cassette 20. A window 32 is provided on the right side 26 and a window 36 is provided on the left side 24, which windows 32 and 36 are operable to allow a user to view the interior contents thereof to determine if there are notes in the cassette 20 after locking. A sliding compression panel 38 is provided which slides along the length of the interior of the cassette 20 to allow notes 40 which are disposed between the compression panel 38 and the opening to be stacked tightly within the cassette 20. The operation of the cassette 20 and the interior workings thereof will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
In the operation of the desktop station 16, the cassette 20 is operable to the stored in a stacked configuration with other cassettes 20, all the cassettes 20 being in an open configuration in the preferred embodiment. When a user desires to fill one of the cassettes 20, the open cassette 20 is retrieved from its storage area and disposed on the desktop station 16. It is not necessary for the desktop station 16 to have an interfacing locking mechanism that is disposed under the door 22, but this is available and shown in this embodiment. The only purpose for the mechanism under the door 22 is to provide a key mechanism for unlocking the locking mechanism internal to the cassette 20. Again, this will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
The operator, after disposing the cassette 20 on the desktop station 16, then hand loads the notes 40 into the interior of the cassette between the compression panel 38 and the end opening of the cassette 20. Typically, the compression panel 38 can be moved toward the bottom or opposite end from the open end, to provide access to the full capacity of the cassette 20. Once the notes 40 are loaded into the cassette 20 to the desired capacity, which may be the full capacity, the compression panel 38 is moved toward the open end and the closed door 30 to "pack" the notes and the door 28 is then slidingly moved upward toward the end opening proximate the door 30, this motion then locking the cassette 20 if a corresponding key mechanism is not available, otherwise the cassette 20 must be removed from the desktop station 16 to lock the cassette 20. The cassette 20 is then removed from the desktop station 16 and disposed on a transport mechanism for transport to the next station, the feeder station 12.
Referring now to FIG. 3, there is illustrated a perspective view of a sorting mechanism 41, which FIG. 3 does not illustrate the details of the sorting mechanism 41. However, the sorting mechanism 41 is operable to retrieve documents, such as notes, from a point 42 and deliver them to one of two points 44 or 46, only two delivery points noted for simplicity purposes. The sorting mechanism 41 is conventional and known by those skilled in the art.
The sorting mechanism 41 has a feeder docking station for feeding notes to the point 42 and two collection docking stations for receiving notes delivered to the points 44 and 46, respectively. When the cassette 20 is transported from the desktop station 16, after locking thereof, the cassette 20 is then disposed in the feeder docking station, which is comprised of a buffer region 48 and a docking region 50. The docking region 50 has associated therewith a key mechanism, similar to the key mechanism disposed under the door 22 in the desktop station 16 of FIG. 2. It is operable to be disposed in the docking region 50 and the key mechanism engaged, such that the door 28 can now be slidingly moved down toward the unopen end of the cassette 20 to expose all of the notes therein. The door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface to allow the notes 40 within the cassette 20 to be moved to the buffer region 48, the surface of the cassette 20, the surface of the door 30 and the lower surface of the buffer region 48 being coplanar.
It can be seen in the embodiment of FIG. 3 that there are a plurality of notes 54 that are disposed in the buffer region 48. These notes 54 are urged upward toward the point 42 with the use of a "paddle" 56. The paddle 56 is mounted on a feeding mechanism 58, which feeding mechanism 58 is operable to reciprocate the paddle along the length of the docking region 50 and buffer region 48. The paddle 56, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, is operable to be reciprocated upward and moved down into the unopen end of the cassette 20 and then pushed down into the cassette 20. It is only necessary for the paddle 56 to rise up high enough to clear the sides of the cassette 20.
In operation, the embodiment of FIG. 3 is illustrated wherein the notes 54 and the buffer region were previously fed in from prior cassette 20. The paddle 56 therefore had cleared the prior cassette and is fully within the buffer region 48, continually urging the notes 54 upward to the point 42. This urging of the notes 54 upward to the point 42 allows the sorting mechanism to strip the notes off. This stripping operation operates at approximately 1,500 notes per minute. When the new cassette 20 is disposed within the docking region 50, the operator in one embodiment then urges the notes 40 upward against the back surface of the paddle 56 and then moves the paddle 56 out of contact with the notes 54 in the buffer region 48 and then moves it vertically upward from the surface of the feeder station and then urges it downward along the length of the feeder station toward the closed end of the cassette 20 until it is proximate to the bottom of the notes 40. The paddle 56 is then engaged with the bottom of the notes 40, such that the notes 40 and the notes 54 now comprise one stack of notes. The paddle 56 then automatically urges the entire combined stack of notes 40 and 54 upward to the point 42. As soon as sufficient notes have been stripped off the top of the combined stack and the combined stack clears the cassette 20, the cassette 20 can be removed and another cassette provided. During this removal, the cassette 20 is allowed to remain open.
In the next operation, the operator will proceed to the next station, the collection station. In this mode, the cassette 20 is disposed within one of the collection docking stations. Each of the collection docking stations has a buffer region 60 and a docking region 62. The buffer region 60 is typically smaller than the buffer region 48, approximately six inches, but it has a similar key device as the feeder docking station in the event that a closed cassette is disposed therein. Once disposed in the docking region 62, the door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface. A feeding mechanism 64 is provided that runs along the length of both buffer region 60 and docking region 62 and has a paddle 68 associated therewith. The paddle 68 is operable to reciprocate downward from the associated one of the points 44-46 as notes are fed therein and will move downward into the associated cassette 20. Once the sorter has determined that the capacity of the cassette 20 has been reached, i.e., the desired note count, it will discontinue routing notes to that particular collection location. The user will then remove the cassette 20, close the door 28 and then store the notes. Typically, there will be some type of bar code for identification purposes on a particular cassette which can be entered into a computer to provide some type of tracking ability. A reader could be implemented for automatically reading the bar code as the cassette is disposed on its associated feeder docking station, collection docking station, or desktop station.
Referring now to FIG. 4, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 in the open position. Each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed around the peripheral edges on the inner side thereof a slot 70 which is a guide slot for the door 28. An end cap 72 is provided to cover the locking mechanism (not shown) and has two groups of three key access holes 74 and 76. The end cap 72 covers the end portion of the door 28 also. However, one of its primary functions is to hide the key mechanism to prevent unlocking of the system and also to protect the locking mechanism.
Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, there are illustrated side views of the left and right sides 24 and 26, respectively. Each of the left and right sides 24 and 26 have associated therewith a rack 78 with a surface extending upward. Each of these racks 78 is operable to interface with a toothed gear 80, as shown in FIG. 4. The left side 24 has disposed below the rack 78 a horizontal slot 84 that runs along the length of the rack 78, whereas the right side 26 has disposed below the rack 78 a plurality of vertical slots 86. The horizontal slot 84 is a guide slot for the compression panel 38, whereas the vertical slots 86 are locking slots, as will be described hereinbelow. In addition, each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed in the open end thereof a slot 90 and a slot 92, respectively, with each of the slots 90 and 92 having a detent 94 associated therewith. The detent 94 is operable to receive a pan head pin 96 on the right side of the door 30, the slot 90 operable to receive a similar pan head pin (not shown). The door 30, as will be described hereinbelow, is operable to reciprocate vertically in the closed position, such that the pin 96 can reciprocate downward into the detent 94. The left and right sides 24 and 26 are fabricated from a plastic material and the pan head pin 96 extends outward over the edge of the slot 90, it being a large diameter, such that it will prevent an individual from prying the sides 24 and 26 apart, gaining entrance thereto and then placing them back together. As will be described hereinbelow, when the door 28 is closed, it overlaps the door 30, preventing it from reciprocating upward and the pan head pin 96 rotating out of the slot 92.
Referring now to FIG. 7, there is illustrated an end view of the compression panel 38. The compression panel 38 is manufactured of a flat metal sheet having disposed on one side thereof a guide pin 100, proximate to the left side 24 and, on the other side thereof, a protrusion 102. The guide pin 100 is operable to be disposed within the guide slot 84 and the protrusion 102 is operable to fit within each of the slots 86 on the right side 26. The gears 80 are operable to be disposed within a slot 106 that has the rack 78 disposed therein and is proximate to the transparent window 32. Only the left side 24 is illustrated. The gears 80 are connected together through a shaft 108, the gears 80 fixedly attached to the shaft 108. In this manner, both gears 80 on either end of the shaft 108 are co-rotatable. The compression panel 38 is slidingly engaged with the shaft 108, such that it can slide in either direction and pivot about the shaft 108. A spring 110 is disposed between the edge of the compression panel 38 and the gear 80 proximate to the left side 24, such that the panel 38 is urged away from the guide slot 84.
In order to move the panel 38, the panel 38 is urged toward the slot 84, such that the guide pin 100 will be inserted in the slot 84. As this happens, the protrusion 102 is moved away from the right side 26 and the slots 86, thus allowing the panel 38 to be urged along the length of the cassette. When the panel 38 is at the appropriate position, the panel 38 is allowed to be moved away from the left side 24 and toward the right side 26 by the spring 110, such that the protrusion 102 will be inserted into one of the slots 86. Typically, this requires some manual manipulation.
The purpose for the fixed configuration of the shaft 108 and the two gears 80 is to prevent the panel 38 from skewing relative to a perpendicular orientation along the path of travel. Therefore, when the panel 38 is urged along the length of the cassette 20, both gears 80 must rotate and maintain a perpendicular orientation.
Referring now to FIG. 8, there is illustrated a detail of the open end showing the door 30 in an open position. The door 30 has associated with the left side a pan head pin 98 for interfacing with the slot 90. The door 30 is operable to rotate about hinges 112, which hinges 112 are asymmetrical, i.e., they are not round. This allows the door 30 to reciprocate in the planar surface thereof. This will allow the door 30 to reciprocate outward away from the pivoting area of the hinges 112, such that the narrow portion of the pan head pins 96 and 98 can insert in the slots 92 and 90, respectively, and then down into the detents 94. On the outermost edge of the door 30, there are provided two slots 114. The slots 114 are operable to interface with corresponding protrusions (not shown) on the docking station.
Referring now to FIG. 9, there is illustrated a side view of the door 30 in a closed position. The door 30 has a recess area 116 on the outer surface thereof which is operable to contain a handle 118. The handle 118 is operable to rotate about a pivot point 120 away from the recess area 116 and extend outward, as illustrated in FIG. 9. This allows the cassette 20 to be picked up. The pivot point 120 is disposed on a vertical protrusion 121 that extends outward from the door 30. A second protrusion 123 is also provided proximate to the end of the door 30 and having a lower height than the protrusion 121. The handle 118 has a pin 125 disposed thereon proximate to the pivot point 120 and slightly outward therefrom. The pin 125 is operable to fit within a recess 127 when the door 30 is closed. When the handle 118 is swung outward from the recess 116, the pin 125 contacts the upper surface of the recess 127 and forces the door 30 downward, such that the pin 98 is forced down into the detent 94. The two perpendicular protrusions 121 and 123 on the surface of the door 30 with the end of the door 28 (not shown) provide an overlap. The protrusions 121 and 123 prevent a would-be thief from slipping a note around the interface between the door 30 and the door 28.
Referring now to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a detail of the feeder docking station. At the feeder docking station, the cassette 20 is disposed in the cassette region 50 just below the buffer region 48. As noted above, the buffer region 48 is approximately equal to the length of the cassette region 50. The feeder mechanism 58 is comprised of a rod 130 that runs along the length of the feeder docking station. A reciprocating device 132 is disposed on the rod 130 and is attached to the paddle 56. The paddle 56 is operable to extend up over the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The reciprocating device 132 is interfaced with a chain 136, the chain constituting a part of the chain drive which is driven by a chain drive mechanism 138 on one end, the upper end, and a pulley mechanism 140 at the opposite end. The chain 136 moves in one direction. The reciprocating mechanism 132 has a release lever associated therewith (not shown) to allow it to be released. This is conventional in a sorter mechanism. Therefore, the reciprocating device 132 can be manually pulled down to a position beneath a group of notes 142.
As noted above, the cassette 20 is disposed in the feeder docking station after a previous cassette has been in the feeder docking station a sufficient amount of time for the paddle 56 to have been reciprocated upward and out of the cassette 20. When the new cassette 20 is disposed in the docking station, the end thereof is interfaced with a plurality of keys 146 that interface with the key slots 74 and 76. Once in the feeder docking station, the door 28 can be opened and door 30 then swiveled outward from the open end. At this point, the paddle 56 is at a location that is higher in the feeder docking station than the open end of the cassette 20. Since a typical cassette holds approximately 2,000 notes, there will be approximately 2,000 notes in the buffer region 48 when a cassette 20 is removed. At a feed rate of 1,500 notes per minute, it requires that a new cassette be disposed in the feeder docking station within less than approximately 1.5 minutes. Since the paddle 56 is reciprocating upward, the notes in the cassette 20 must be urged upward to contact the notes in the buffer region 50 and then the paddle 56 disposed behind the combined groups of notes. This can be done by two methods. In the first method, the user can push the notes in the buffer region upward to maintain a constant pressure thereon and then tilt the paddle 56 by rotating it after releasing it from the chain drive and then sliding it down the rod 130 to a point behind the notes in the cassette 20. The paddle 56 can then be utilized to slide the notes upward until they contact the notes in the buffer region 50, at which time the paddle 56 is then re-engaged with the chain drive. A second method is to urge the notes in the cassette upward from the cassette 20 to contact the back of the paddle 56, this being a manual operation. Thereafter, the user can hold these notes in place, rotate the paddle 56 upward and then place it behind the combined notes in the cassette and the ones previously in the buffer region 48. Thereafter, the operator waits for the notes to be urged completely out of the cassette 20 and then a new cassette placed in the feeder docking station. This is therefore a continuous and seamless operation to the sorter. In order to insure that the operation is continuous, the drive mechanism 138 provides a constant pressure on the notes. This is facilitated through the use of a pressure switch (not shown), which prevents too much pressure being placed on the notes with the paddle 56 or a direct drive motor. Either method is acceptable.
In order to facilitate removal of the cassette 20, a removal lever 150 is provided having an actuating arm 152. The actuating arm 152 is operable to be actuated and to cause the door 30 (not shown) to be urged upward, allowing the user to then complete door closing.
Referring now to FIG. 11, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 disposed in the collection docking station. The collection docking station is substantially similar to the feeder docking station, with the exception that it operates in the reverse end that it does not have as large a buffer region. The buffer region is approximately 6 inches, less than the length of a cassette 20. In this mechanism, the paddle 68 is reciprocated along a rod (not shown) similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. A reciprocating block 154 is provided which is operable to reciprocate along this rod (not shown). The reciprocating block 154 is interfaced with an engaging member that contacts the side of a toothed belt 156, the toothed belt 156 being disposed on an idler pulley 158, that is toothed, and to a toothed drive pulley 160 on the other end. Drive pulley 160 is driven by a belt drive motor 164. The blade 68 is operable to reciprocate upward a sufficient vertical distance to clear notes 168 that are disposed in the collection docking station. The paddle 68 can then be disengaged with the belt 56 and reciprocated to a desired position.
The operation is such that notes, after the sorting operation, are routed to the particular collection docking station in which the cassette 20 resides and are, via gravity, disposed therein. The surface of the collection docking station is at approximately a forty five degree angle. When the paddle is reciprocated up to the closest position to the sorting mechanism, the notes will be disposed in the sorter and, in response to notes coming into the particular collection docking station, the belt drive motor 164 will increment the belt 156 and reciprocate the paddle 68 down toward the lower end of the collection docking station, which is also the closed end of the cassette 20, when the cassette 20 is disposed in the collection docking station. As will be described hereinbelow, there are sensors that sense when the paddle 68 approaches the cassette 20 and, a switch associated with the cassette 20 being in place will be sensed. If this switch is set, indicating a cassette 20 is disposed therein, the operation will continue and the blade 68 will move downward. Once a sufficient number of notes to fill the capacity of the cassette 20 have been disposed at a particular collection station, the paddle 68 will then be moved downward in the cassette 20, the paddle 68 reciprocated vertically upward and then moved all the way to the top, such that new notes coming into the collection docking station can then be disposed on the upper surface of the paddle 68. The cassette 20 can then have the door thereof closed, and then removed from the collection docking station. A new empty cassette is then disposed therein. Typically, as described above, the cassette 20 is already open. However, the locking keys (not shown) are disposed on the collection docking station to allow the cassette 20 be in an unlocked position and thereafter allow the door 28 to be slidingly moved upward for closure.
Referring now to FIG. 12, there is illustrated a side view of the paddle 68 and the reciprocating member 154. The paddle 68 has a lower flat surface 170, which contacts the notes 168. An extending arm 172 extends upward over the right side 24 of the cassette 20 and downward to a vertically reciprocating arm 174. The vertically reciprocating arm 174 reciprocates within a slide bracket 176. Slide bracket 176 is attached to the reciprocating member 154, reciprocating member 154 having a cylindrical bore 178 disposed therethrough that is operable to reciprocate along the rod that was not shown in FIG. 11 and that is similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. Below the reciprocating member 178 is disposed a toothed block 180, toothed block 180 shown in a side view and operable to interface with the teeth on the inside surface of the belt 156 on the outer band. Whenever it is desired to release the toothed block 180 from the belt 156, it is only necessary to pull up on the arm 172 which will rotate the toothed block 180 away from the surface of the belt 156.
Referring now to FIG. 13, there is illustrated a top view of the collection docking station with the cassette 20 removed. The collection docking station has a flat plate 182 with sides 184 and 186 associated therewith, these providing a guide for the cassette 20 on either side thereof A door 184 is provided, which is substantially identical to the door 22 on the desktop docking station 16 in FIG. 2. This door 184 covers the key members 146 described above with respect to FIG. 10 and is operable to open in response to the cassette 20 being placed therein. The purpose of the door 184, as described above, is for protection and, also for a visual view to require the user to place the cassette above the door and then slide it down to open the door and insert the keys. Otherwise, the user might try to push down upon the keys 146, thus damaging the keys 146. A switch orifice 190 is provided for containing a switch 192, which switch 192 indicates the presence of the cassette 20 when the door 30 is opened. The door 30 is operable to open into a space 194 which has a plate 196 disposed on the upper end thereof. This plate 196 is raised and has two projections 198 and 200 which are operable to interface with the slots 114 and the door 30, as illustrated in FIG. 8. Therefore, the door 30 can be laid flat such that a flat surface is presented. The release lever device 150, described above with respect to FIG. 10, is disposed on the upper left side of the cassette 20 when disposed therein. An extending lever member 204 extends outward in front of the cassette 20 when installed and under the edge of the door 30, substantially under the pan head pin 98. Therefore, it is only necessary to actuate the lever 152 to raise the lever member 204 and pull the door 30 upward to allow the user to grasp this lever.
A sensor 206 is provided in the side of the buffer region 60 which is operable to sense the presence of notes on the surface of the paddle 68. The paddle 68 is reciprocated all the way up to the sorter such that it is past the sensor 206. The sensor will indicate that there are no notes past that point. Once the notes have been collected to a certain thickness, the paddle 68 will reciprocate past the sensor 206 and the sensor 206 will provide a signal to a central control system. The central control system will then determine if the switch 192 is depressed, indicating the presence of a cassette. If not, then the system will be shut down only when the paddle is not in the buffer region. If it is in the buffer region, it will continue to operate.
Referring now to FIG. 14, there is illustrated a top view of the closed end 72 of the cassette 20, illustrating the locking mechanism. A first shaft 210 extends between the left side 24 and right side 26 and has associated therewith on one side two pivoting lever members 212 and 214. On the opposite side, proximate to the right side 26, are disposed two similar pivoting lever members 216 and 218. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are separated by a plastic bushing 220 attached to the shaft 210 with springs 222 and 224 disposed between the block 220 and pivoting lever members 212 and 214, respectively. Similarly, a plastic block 226 is disposed between pivoting lever members 216 and 218 and separated therefrom by springs 228 and 230. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are disposed above the outside key access holes 74 on the left side of the end 72 and the two pivoting members 216 and 218 are each disposed against opposite ones of the outside holes on the key access hole 76. The key members 146 are comprised of two outside key members 231 and 232 and a central key member 236. The outside key members 231 and 232 of the key portion associated with the key access holes 74 are operable to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, on the key member 146 associated with the key access hole 76, the outer key members 231 and 232 are operable to pass through the outside key access holes 76 to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 216 and 218.
A second shaft 240 is provided that is disposed between the left side 24 and the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The shaft 240 is closer to the end 72. A pivoting lever 242 is disposed on the shaft 240 to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, a pivoting lever 244 is disposed on the shaft 240 and allowed to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever member 216 and 218. Disposed on each side of the pivoting members 242 are tracks (not shown}. These tracks are operable to receive pins 246 that extend outward from the associated pivoting members 212 and 214, or 216 and 218. This will be described in more in detail with respect to FIG. 15. The pivoting lever members 242 are urged upward with the center key members 236 in each of the key devices 146. As will be described hereinbelow, when the pivoting lever 242 is urged upward, it is necessary for the pivoting action of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214, and 216 and 216 to traverse the path such that the pins 246 disposed in the ends and extending outward therefrom will traverse a particular path. Therefore, there is a defined shape to each of the members 231 and 232 which will determine this path.
Referring now to FIG. 15, there is illustrated a side view of a locking member looking into the side of the right side 26. There is provided a locking lever 250, which is pivoted on one end at a pivot point 252 and has a "crook" 254 on the other end thereof, this crook being at a distance from the pivot point 252, such that the crook 252 will pivot into the path 70. Whenever the door 28 slides through the guide 70 into the crook 254, the locking lever 250 rotated such that the crook 254 is in that path, this will prevent further movement. Additionally, once the door 28 is urged against the crook 254, the direction of forces is "normal" to the pivot point 252, such that the lever 250 is not stressed, the force being along the length thereof.
The lever member 244 extends outward from the shaft 240 and has a pivoting shaft 256 disposed thereon, which is pivoted about a hole in the distal end of the locking lever 250, distal from the pivoting point 252. Whenever the lever 244 is urged upward by the locking pin 234, the pivoting shaft 256 will be urged upward, pivoting the locking lever 250 about the pivot point 252 and moving the crook 254 away from the path 70, to thereby allow the door 28 to pass thereby.
The pivoting lever 244 has a track 260 formed in the side thereof that is operable to interface with the pin 246 in the lever 216. An opposite path is disposed on the opposite side to interface with the pin 246 in the pivoting lever 218. This path 260 is configured such that, as lever 244 pivots upward, the end of the pivoting lever 216 must pivot in such a manner that the pin 246 will meander along the correct path. If the shape of the key member 231 is not correct, the path will be wrong and it will fall into defined "pockets" which will prevent further movement and further pivoting of lever 244. The shape of both key members 231 and 232 must be correct in order to insure that the end of the pivoting members 216 and 218 traverse the defined path.
In summary, there has been provided a currency sorting system utilizing a cassette for transporting the currency between locations. The cassette is a secured device that has an interior with a door that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the currency and an end that allows currency to be reciprocated out in a push operation. The cassette has a locking device for engaging with a corresponding key on a docking station, such that when the cassette is disposed on the docking station, the door will open. When removed from the docking station, and the door is closed, the door cannot be opened. The cassette is hand loaded at one docking station and then secured for movement to a second docking station that is associated with a sorting mechanism. On the sorting mechanism, it is necessary to feed the notes into the sorter input. The feeding docking station is approximately twice the length of the cassette with a cassette region and a buffer region. A paddle is utilized to extend downward into the cassette to urge the notes up into the buffer region. Once the notes are in the buffer region, the cassette can be removed and another cassette disposed therein and the paddle again moved into the cassette to urge the notes outward in a continuous motion. When the cassette is removed, it is then disposed in a third collection docking station in a collection slot. The collection slot is associated with a sorter output wherein notes that are sorted are disposed in particular ones of the collection docking stations. A paddle is provided in this station that reciprocates downward into the cassette as notes are disposed in that particular docking station. When the cassette is full, it can then be removed.
Although the preferred embodiment has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

  ......................................................................... Cahier technique no. 158 Calculation of short-circuit currents B. de Metz-Noblat F. Dumas C. Poulain Collection Technique Building a New Electric World "Cahiers Techniques" is a collection of documents intended for engineers and technicians, people in the industry who are looking for more in-depth information in order to complement that given in product catalogues. Furthermore, these "Cahiers Techniques" are often considered as helpful "tools" for training courses. They provide knowledge on new technical and technological developments in the electrotechnical field and electronics. They also provide better understanding of various phenomena observed in electrical installations, systems and equipment. Each "Cahier Technique" provides an in-depth study of a precise subject in the fields of electrical networks, protection devices, monitoring and control and industrial automation systems. The latest publications can be downloaded from the Schneider Electric internet web site. Code: http://www.schneider-electric.com Section: Press Please contact your Schneider Electric representative if you want either a "Cahier Technique" or the list of available titles.

This “Cahier Technique” reviews the calculation methods for short-circuit currents as laid down by standards such as IEC 60909. It is intended for radial and meshed low-voltage (LV) and high-voltage (HV) circuits. The aim is to provide a further understanding of the calculation methods, essential when determining short-circuit currents, even when computerised methods are employed. the impedance method Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.4 1 Introduction Electrical installations almost always require protection against short-circuits wherever there is an electrical discontinuity. This most often corresponds to points where there is a change in conductor cross-section. The short-circuit current must be calculated at each level in the installation in view of determining the characteristics of the equipment required to withstand or break the fault current. The flow chart in Figure 1 indicates the procedure for determining the various shortcircuit currents and the resulting parameters for the different protection devices of a low-voltage installation. In order to correctly select and adjust the protection devices, the graphs in Figures 2, 3 and 4 are used. Two values of the short-circuit current must be evaluated: c The maximum short-circuit current, used to determine v The breaking capacity of the circuit breakers v The making capacity of the circuit breakers v The electrodynamic withstand capacity of the wiring system and switchgear The maximum short-circuit current corresponds to a short-circuit in the immediate vicinity of the downstream terminals of the protection device. It must be calculated accurately and used with a safety margin. c The minimum short-circuit current, essential when selecting the time-current curve for circuit breakers and fuses, in particular when Upstream Ssc u (%) Isc at transformer terminals Isc of main LV switchboard outgoers Isc at head of secondary switchboards Isc at head of final switchboards Isc at end of final outgoers Conductor characteristics b Busbars v Length v Width v Thickness b Cables v Type of insulation v Single-core or multicore v Length v Cross-section b Environment v Ambient temperature v Installation method v Number of contiguous circuits Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity Inst. trip setting Main circuit breaker Main LV switchboard distribution circuit breakers Secondary distribution circuit breakers Final distribution circuit breakers b Feeder current ratings b Voltage drops HV / LV transformer rating Load rating sc b Power factor b Coincidence factor b Duty factor b Foreseeable expansion factor Fig. 1 : Short-circuit (Isc) calculation procedure when designing a low-voltage electrical installation (ST = short time; Inst. = instantaneous) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.5 v Cables are long and/or the source impedance is relatively high (generators, UPSs) v Protection of life depends on circuit breaker or fuse operation, essentially the case for TN and IT electrical systems Note that the minimum short-circuit current corresponds to a short-circuit at the end of the protected line, generally phase-to-earth for LV and phase-to-phase for HV (neutral not distributed), under the least severe operating conditions (fault at the end of a feeder and not just downstream from a protection device, one transformer in service when two can be connected, etc.). Note also that whatever the case, for whatever type of short-circuit current (minimum or maximum), the protection device must clear the short-circuit within a time tc that is compatible with the thermal stresses that can be withstood by the protected cable: i 2 ∫ dt k A2 2 i (see Fig. 2, 3, and 4) where A is the cross-sectional area of the conductors and k is a constant calculated on the basis of different correction factors for the cable installation method, contiguous circuits, etc. Further practical information may be found in the “Electrical Installation Guide” published by Schneider Electric (see the bibliography). 1.1 The main types of short-circuits Various types of short-circuits can occur in electrical installations. Characteristics of short-circuits The primary characteristics are: c Duration (self-extinguishing, transient and steady-state) c Origin v Mechanical (break in a conductor, accidental electrical contact between two conductors via a foreign conducting body such as a tool or an animal) v Internal or atmospheric overvoltages a5 s Iz1 < Iz2 t 1 2 I2t = k2S2 I Fig. 2 : The I2t characteristics of a conductor depending on the ambient temperature (1 and 2 represent the rms value of the current in the conductor at different temperatures θ1 and θ2, with θ1 > θ2; Iz being the limit of the permissible current under steady-state conditions).

This type of fault often degenerates into a three phase fault c Three-phase (only 5% of initial faults) These different short-circuit currents are presented in Figure 5 . Consequences of short-circuits The consequences are variable depending on the type and the duration of the fault, the point in the installation where the fault occurs and the short-circuit power. Consequences include: c At the fault location, the presence of electrical arcs, resulting in v Damage to insulation v Welding of conductors v Fire and danger to life c On the faulty circuit v Electrodynamic forces, resulting in - Deformation of the busbars - Disconnection of cables v Excessive temperature rise due to an increase in Joule losses, with the risk of damage to insulation c On other circuits in the network or in near-by networks v Voltage dips during the time required to clear the fault, ranging from a few milliseconds to a few hundred milliseconds v Shutdown of a part of the network, the extent of that part depending on the design of the network and the discrimination levels offered by the protection devices v Dynamic instability and/or the loss of machine synchronisation v Disturbances in control / monitoring circuits v etc. Fig. 5 : Different types of short-circuits and their currents.

Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.7 1.2 Development of the short-circuit current A simplified network comprises a source of constant AC power, a switch, an impedance Zsc that represents all the impedances upstream of the switch, and a load impedance Zs (see Fig. 6 ). In a real network, the source impedance is made up of everything upstream of the short-circuit including the various networks with different voltages (HV, LV) and the series-connected wiring systems with different cross-sectional areas (A) and lengths. In Figure 6, when the switch is closed and no fault is present, the design current Is flows through the network. When a fault occurs between A and B, the negligible impedance between these points results in a very high short-circuit current Isc that is limited only be impedance Zsc. The current Isc develops under transient conditions depending on the reactances X and the resistances R that make up impedance Zsc: Zsc = R X 2 2 + In power distribution networks, reactance X = L ϕ is normally much greater than resistance R and the R / X ratio is between 0.1 and 0.3. The ratio is virtually equals cos ϕ for low values: cos R R X 2 2 ϕ = + However, the transient conditions prevailing while the short-circuit current develops differ depending on the distance between the fault location and the generator. This distance is not necessarily physical, but means that the generator impedances are less than the impedance of the elements between the generator and the fault location. Fault far from the generator This is the most frequent situation. The transient conditions are those resulting from the application of a voltage to a reactor-resistance circuit. This voltage is: e = E 2 sin t + (ω α) Current i is then the sum of the two components: i = i i ac dc + c The first (iac) is alternating and sinusoidal i = sin t + ac Ι 2 (ω αϕ− ) where I = E Zsc , α = angle characterising the difference between the initiation of the fault and zero voltage. c The second (idc) is an aperiodic component i dc - R L t = − - 2 si Ι αϕ n e ( ) . Its initial value depends on a and its decay rate is proportional to R / L. At the initiation of the short-circuit, i is equal to zero by definition (the design current Is is negligible), hence: i = iac + idc = 0 Figure 7 shows the graphical composition of i as the algebraic sum of its two components iac and idc Fig. 6 : Simplified network diagram. R A Zsc B X e Zs Fig. 7 : Graphical presentation and decomposition of a short-circuit current occuring far from the generator.

The voltage can therefore be expressed as: u = E 2 . sin ( t + ) ω α . The current therefore develops as follows: i = E 2 Z sin t + - - - e sin - R L t (ω αϕ αϕ ) ( )         with its two components, one being alternating with a shift equal to ϕ with respect to the voltage and the second aperiodic and decaying to zero as t tends to infinity. Hence the two extreme cases defined by: c α = ϕ ≈ π / 2, said to be symmetrical (or balanced) (see Fig. a ) The fault current can be defined by: i = E 2 Z sin t ω which, from the initiation, has the same shape as for steady state conditions with a peak value E / Z. c α = 0, said to be asymmetrical (or unbalanced) (see Fig. b ) The fault current can be defined by: i = E 2 Z sin t - + sin e- R L t ( ) ωϕ ϕ         Its initial peak value ip therefore depends on ϕ on the R / X ≈ cos ϕ ratio of the circuit.

The factor e R L − t is inversely proportional to the aperiodic component damping, determined by the R / L or R / X ratios. The value of ip must therefore be calculated to determine the making capacity of the required circuit breakers and to define the electrodynamic forces that the installation as a whole must be capable of withstanding. Its value may be deduced from the rms value of the symmetrical short-circuit current Ιa using the equation: ip = κ . r . Ia, where the coefficient κ is indicated by the curve in Figure 9 , as a function of the ratio R / X or R / L, corresponding to the expression: κ = + − 1 02 0 98 3 . . e R X Fault near the generator When the fault occurs in the immediate vicinity of the generator supplying the circuit, the variation in the impedance of the generator, in this case the dominant impedance, damps the short-circuit current. The transient current-development conditions are in this case modified by the variation in the electromotive force resulting from the shortcircuit. For simplicity, the electromotive force is assumed to be constant and the internal reactance of the machine variable. The reactance develops in three stages: c Subtransient (the first 10 to 20 milliseconds of the fault) c Transient (up to 500 milliseconds) c Steady-state (or synchronous reactance) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.9 Note that in the indicated order, the reactance acquires a higher value at each stage, i.e. the subtransient reactance is less than the transient reactance, itself less than the synchronous reactance. The successive effect of the three reactances leads to a gradual reduction in the short-circuit current which is the sum of four components (see Fig. 10 ): c The three alternating components (subtransient, transient and steady-state) c The aperiodic component resulting from the development of the current in the circuit (inductive) This short-circuit current i(t) is maximum for a closing angle corresponding to the zero-crossing of the voltage at the instant the fault occurs.

Note that the decrease in the generator reactance is faster than that of the aperiodic component. This is a rare situation that can cause saturation of the magnetic circuits and interruption problems because several periods occur before the current passes through zero. 0 t (s) 0 t (s) 0 t (s) 0 t (s) 0 t (s) a) b) c) d) e) 0.3 Subtransient Transient Steady-state 0.1 0.5 Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.10 It is therefore given by the following expression: it E X X e X X e X t E X e d d t T d d t T d d dd a t T ( ) '' ' / ' / '' / '' ' = −       + −       +         − − − − 2 11 11 1 2 cos ω Where: E: Phase-to-neutral rms voltage across the generator terminals X"d: Subtransient reactance X'd: Transient reactance Xd: Synchronous (steady-state) reactance T"d: Subtransient time constant T'd: Transient time constant Ta: Aperiodic time constant Practically speaking, information on the development of the short-circuit current is not essential: c In a LV installation, due to the speed of the breaking devices, the value of the subtransient short-circuit current, denoted I" k , and of the maximum asymmetrical peak amplitude ip is sufficient when determining the breaking capacities of the protection devices and the electrodynamic forces c In LV power distribution and in HV applications, however, the transient short-circuit current is often used if breaking occurs before the steady-state stage, in which case it becomes useful to use the short-circuit breaking current, denoted Ib, which determines the breaking capacity of the timedelayed circuit breakers. Ib is the value of the short-circuit current at the moment interruption is effective, i.e. following a time t after the beginning of the short-circuit, where t = tmin. Time tmin (minimum time delay) is the sum of the minimum operating time of a protection relay and the shortest opening time of the associated circuit breaker, i.e. the shortest time between the appearance of the short-circuit current and the initial separation of the pole contacts on the switching device. Figure 11 presents the various currents of the short-circuits defined above. 1.3 Standardised Isc calculations The standards propose a number of methods. c Application guide C 15-105, which supplements NF C 15-100 (Normes Françaises) (low-voltage AC installations), details three methods v The “impedance” method, used to calculate fault currents at any point in an installation with a high degree of accuracy. This method involves adding the various resistances and reactances of the fault loop separately, from (and including) the source to the given point, and then calculating the corresponding impedance. The Isc value is finally obtained by applying Ohm’s law: Isc = Un 3∑(Z) . All the characteristics of the various elements in the fault loop must be known (sources and wiring systems). v The “composition” method, which may be used when the characteristics of the power supply are not known. The upstream impedance of the given circuit is calculated on the basis of an Fig. 11 : short-circuit currents near a generator (schematic diagram). i Asymmetrical Symmetrical Subtrans. Transient Steady-state 2r I" k ip 2r Ik Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.11 estimate of the short-circuit current at its origin. Power factor cos ϕ ≈ R / X is assumed to be identical at the origin of the circuit and the fault location. In other words, it is assumed that the elementary impedances of two successive sections in the installation are sufficiently similar in their characteristics to justify the replacement of vectorial addition of the impedances by algebraic addition. This approximation may be used to calculate the value of the short-circuit current modulus with sufficient accuracy for the addition of a circuit. v The “conventional” method, which can be used when the impedances or the Isc in the installation upstream of the given circuit are not known, to calculate the minimum short-circuit currents and the fault currents at the end of a line. It is based on the assumption that the voltage at the circuit origin is equal to 80% of the rated voltage of the installation during the shortcircuit or the fault. Conductor reactance is neglected for sizes under 150 mm2. It is taken into account for large sizes by increasing the resistance 15% for 150 mm2, 20% for 185 mm2, 25% for 240 mm2 and 30% for 300 mm2. This method is used essentially for final circuits with origins sufficiently far from the source. It is not applicable in installations supplied by a generator. c Standard IEC 60909 (VDE 0102) applies to all networks, radial or meshed, up to 550 kV. This method, based on the Thevenin theorem, calculates an equivalent voltage source at the short-circuit location and then determines the corresponding short-circuit current. All network feeders as well as the synchronous and asynchronous machines are replaced in the calculation by their impedances (positive sequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence). All line capacitances and the parallel admittances of non-rotating loads, except those of the zero-sequence system, are neglected. 1.4 Methods presented in this document In this “Cahier Technique” publication, two methods are presented for the calculation of short-circuit currents in radial networks: c The impedance method, reserved primarily for LV networks, was selected for its high degree of accuracy and its instructive value, given that virtually all characteristics of the circuit are taken into account c The IEC 60909 method, used primarily for HV networks, was selected for its accuracy and its analytical character. More technical in nature, it implements the symmetrical-component principle 1.5 Basic assumptions To simplify the short-circuit calculations, a number of assumptions are required. These impose limits for which the calculations are valid but usually provide good approximations, facilitating comprehension of the physical phenomena and consequently the short-circuit current calculations. They nevertheless maintain a fully acceptable level of accuracy, “erring” systematically on the conservative side. The assumptions used in this document are as follows: c The given network is radial with nominal voltages ranging from LV to HV, but not exceeding 550 kV, the limit set by standard IEC 60909 c The short-circuit current, during a three-phase short-circuit, is assumed to occur simultaneously on all three phases c During the short-circuit, the number of phases involved does not change, i.e. a three-phase fault remains three-phase and a phase-to-earth fault remains phase-to-earth c For the entire duration of the short-circuit, the voltages responsible for the flow of the current and the short-circuit impedance do not change significantly c Transformer regulators or tap-changers are assumed to be set to a main position (if the short-circuit occurs away far from the generator, the actual position of the transformer regulator or tap-changers does not need to be taken into account c Arc resistances are not taken into account c All line capacitances are neglected c Load currents are neglected c All zero-sequence impedances are taken into account Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.12 2 Calculation of Isc by the impedance method 2.1 Isc depending on the different types of short-circuit Three-phase short-circuit This fault involves all three phases. Short-circuit current Isc3 is equal to: Ιsc U / 3 Zcc 3 = where U (phase-to-phase voltage) corresponds to the transformer no-load voltage which is 3 to 5% greater than the on-load voltage across the terminals. For example, in 390 V networks, the phase-to-phase voltage adopted is U = 410 V, and the phase-to-neutral voltage is U / 3 = 237 V. Calculation of the short-circuit current therefore requires only calculation of Zsc, the impedance equal to all the impedances through which Isc flows from the generator to the location of the fault, i.e. the impedances of the power sources and the lines (see Fig. 12 ). This is, in fact, the “positive-sequence” impedance per phase: Zsc = R X  ∑ ∑   +     2 2 where ∑R = the sum of series resistances, ∑X = the sum of series reactances. It is generally considered that three-phase faults provoke the highest fault currents. The fault current in an equivalent diagram of a polyphase system is limited by only the impedance of one phase at the phase-to-neutral voltage of thenetwork. Calculation of Isc3 is therefore essential for selection of equipment (maximum current and electrodynamic withstand capability). Fig. 12 : The various short-circuit currents.

Zsc 2 = Ιsc U / 3 Zsc + Z o o = Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.13 Phase-to-phase short-circuit clear of earth This is a fault between two phases, supplied with a phase-to-phase voltage U. In this case, the short-circuit current Isc2 is less than that of a three-phase fault: Ι ΙΙ sc U 2 Zsc = 3 2 sc 0.86 sc 2 3 3 = ≈ For a fault occuring near rotating machines, the impedance of the machines is such that Isc2 is close to Isc3. Phase-to-neutral short-circuit clear of earth This is a fault between one phase and the neutral, supplied with a phase-to-neutral voltage V = U / 3 The short-circuit current Isc1 is: Ιsc = U / 3 Zsc + Z 1 Ln In certain special cases of phase-to-neutral faults, the zero-sequence impedance of the source is less than Zsc (for example, at the terminals of a star-zigzag connected transformer or of a generator under subtransient conditions). In this case, the phase-to-neutral fault current may be greater than that of a three-phase fault. Phase-to-earth fault (one or two phases) This type of fault brings the zero-sequence impedance Zo into play. Except when rotating machines are involved (reduced zero-sequence impedance), the shortcircuit current Isco is less than that of a three phase fault. Calculation of Isco may be necessary, depending on the neutral system (system earthing arrangement), in view of defining the setting thresholds for the zero-sequence (HV) or earthfault (LV) protection devices. Figure 12 shows the various short-circuit currents. 2.2 Determining the various short-circuit impedances This method involves determining the shortcircuit currents on the basis of the impedance represented by the “circuit” through which the short-circuit current flows. This impedance may be calculated after separately summing the various resistances and reactances in the fault loop, from (and including) the power source to the fault location. (The circled numbers X may be used to come back to important information while reading the example at the end of this section.) Network impedances c Upstream network impedance Generally speaking, points upstream of the power source are not taken into account. Available data on the upstream network is therefore limited to that supplied by the power distributor, i.e. only the short-circuit power Ssc in MVA. The equivalent impedance of the upstream network is: 1 Zup = U Ssc 2 where U is the no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the network. The upstream resistance and reactance may be deduced from Rup / Zup (for HV) by: Rup / Zup ≈ 0.3 at 6 kV; Rup / Zup ≈ 0.2 at 20 kV; Rup / Zup ≈ 0.1 at 150 kV. As, Xup Za - Ra = 2 2 , Xup Zup = 1 - Rup Z pu       2 2 Therefore, for 20 kV, Xup Zup . = 1 - 0.2 ( ) = 2 0 980 Xup 0.980 Zup at 20kV, = hence the approximation Xup Zup ≈ . c Internal transformer impedance The impedance may be calculated on the basis of the short-circuit voltage usc expressed as a percentage: 3 Z u 100 U Sn T sc 2 = , U = no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the transformer; Sn = transformer kVA rating; u 100 sc = voltage that must be applied to the primary winding of the transformer for the rated current to flow through the secondary winding, when the LV secondary terminals are shortcircuited. For public distribution MV / LV transformers, the values of usc have been set by the European Harmonisation document HD 428-1S1 issued in October 1992 (see Fig. 13 ) .

For low power levels, however, calculation of ZT is required because the ratio RT / XT is higher. The resistance is calculated using the joule losses (W) in the windings: W = 3 R R W 3 n T T 2 Ι Ι n2 ⇒ = Notes: 5 v When n identically-rated transformers are connected in parallel, their internal impedance values, as well as the resistance and reactance values, must be divided by n v Particular attention must be paid to special transformers, for example, the transformers for rectifier units have Usc values of up to 10 to 12% in order to limit short-circuit currents. When the impedance upstream of the transformer and the transformer internal impedance are taken into account, the shortcircuit current may be expressed as: Ιsc = U 3 Zup ZT ( + ) Initially, Zup and ZT may be considered comparable to their respective reactances. The short-circuit impedance Zsc is therefore equal to the algebraic sum of the two. The upstream network impedance may be neglected, in which case the new current value is: Ι'sc = U 3 ZT The relative error is: ∆Ι Ι Ι Ι Ι sc sc sc - sc sc Z p Z U Ssc T u U 2 sc 2 ' = == u 100 Sn i.e. : ∆Ι Ι sc sc u Sn Ssc sc = 100 Figure 14 indicates the level of conservative error in the calculation of Isc, due to the fact that the upstream impedance is neglected. The figure demonstrates clearly that it is possible to neglect the upstream impedance for networks where the short-circuit power Ssc is much higher than the transformer kVA rating Sn. For example, when Ssc / Sn = 300, the error is approximately 5%. c Line impedance The line impedance ZL depends on the resistance per unit length, the reactance per unit length and the length of the line. v The resistance per unit length of overhead lines, cables and busbars is calculated as R A L = ρ where S = cross-sectional area of the conductor; ρ = conductor resistivity, however the value used varies, depending on the calculated short-circuit current (minimum or maximum). 6 The table in Figure 15 provides values for each of the above-mentioned cases. Practically speaking, for LV and conductors with cross-sectional areas less than 150 mm2, only the resistance is taken into account (RL < 0.15 mΩ / m when A > 150 mm2). v The reactance per unit length of overhead lines, cables and busbars may be calculated as X L 15.7 144.44 Log d r L == +            ω  Fig. 14 : Resultant error in the calculation of the short-circuit current when the upstream network impedance Zup is neglected. 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 0 5 10 12 Sn (kVA) Ssc = 250 MVA Ssc = 500 MVA ∆Isc/Isc (%) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.15 expressed as mΩ / km for a single-phase or three-phase delta cable system, where (in mm): r = radius of the conducting cores; d = average distance between conductors. NB : Above, Log = decimal logarithm. For overhead lines, the reactance increases slightly in proportion to the distance between conductors (Log d t       ), and therefore in proportion to the operating voltage. 7 the following average values are to be used: X = 0.3 Ω / km (LV lines); X = 0.4 Ω / km (MV or HV lines). Figure 16 shows the various reactance values for conductors in LV applications, depending on the wiring system (practical values drawn from French standards, also used in other European countries). The following average values are to be used: - 0.08 mΩ / m for a three-phase cable ( ), and, for HV applications, between 0.1 and 0.15 mΩ / m. 8 - 0.09 mΩ / m for touching, single-conductor cables (flat or triangular ); 9 - 0.15 mΩ / m as a typical value for busbars ( ) and spaced, single-conductor cables ( ) ; For “sandwiched-phase” busbars (e.g. Canalis - Telemecanique), the reactance is considerably lower. Notes : v The impedance of the short lines between the distribution point and the HV / LV transformer may be neglected. This assumption gives a conservative error concerning the short-circuit current. The error increases in proportion to the transformer rating v The cable capacitance with respect to the earth (common mode), which is 10 to 20 times greater than that between the lines, must be taken into account for earth faults.

If one of the values, RL or XL, is low with respect to the other, it may be neglected because the resulting error for impedance ZL is consequently very low. For example, if the ratio between RL and XL is 3, the error in ZL is 5.1%. The curves for RL and XL (see Fig. 17 ) may be used to deduce the cable cross-sectional areas for which the impedance may be considered comparable to the resistance or to the reactance. Examples : v First case: Consider a three-phase cable, at 20°C, with copper conductors. Their reactance is 0.08 mΩ / m. The RL and XL curves (see Fig. 17) indicate that impedance ZL approaches two asymptotes, RL for low cable cross-sectional areas and XL = 0.08 mΩ / m for high cable cross-sectional areas. For the low and high cable cross-sectional areas, the impedance ZL curve may be considered identical to the asymptotes. The given cable impedance is therefore considered, with a margin of error less than 5.1%, comparable to: - A resistance for cable cross-sectional areas less than 74 mm2 - A reactance for cable cross-sectional areas greater than 660 mm2 v Second case: Consider a three-phase cable, at 20 °C, with aluminium conductors. As above, the impedance ZL curve may be considered identical to the asymptotes, but for cable crosssectional areas less than 120 mm2 and greater than 1,000 mm2 (curves not shown) Impedance of rotating machines. c Synchronous generators The impedances of machines are generally expressed as a percentage, for example: x n 100 sc = I I (where x is the equivalent of the transformer usc). Consider: 10 Z = x 100 U Sn 2 where U = no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the generator, Sn = generator VA rating. 11 What is more, given that the value of R / X is low, in the order of 0.05 to 0.1 for MV and 0.1 to 0.2 for LV, impedance Z may be considered comparable to reactance X. Values for x are given in the table in Figure 18 for turbogenerators with smooth rotors and for “hydraulic” generators with salient poles (low speeds). In the table, it may seem surprising to see that the synchronous reactance for a shortcircuit exceeds 100% (at that point in time, Isc < In) . However, the short-circuit current is essentially inductive and calls on all the reactive power that the field system, even over-excited, can supply, whereas the rated current essentially carries the active power supplied by the turbine (cos ϕ from 0.8 to 1). c Synchronous compensators and motors The reaction of these machines during a shortcircuit is similar to that of generators. 12 They produce a current in the network that depends on their reactance in % (see Fig. 19 ). c Asynchronous motors When an asynchronous motor is cut from the network, it maintains a voltage across its terminals that disappears within a few hundredths of a second. When a short-circuit occurs across the terminals, the motor supplies a current that disappears even more rapidly, according to time constants in the order of: Fig. 18 : Generator reactance values. in per unit.

Consequently, the large number of LV motors, with low individual outputs, present on industrial sites may be a source of difficulties in that it is not easy to foresee the average number of motors running that will contribute to the fault when a short-circuit occurs. Individual calculation of the reverse current for each motor, taking into account the line impedance, is therefore a tedious and futile task. Common practice, notably in the United States, is to take into account the combined contribution to the fault current of all the asynchronous LV motors in an installation. 13 They are therefore thought of as a unique source, capable of supplying to the busbars a current equal to Istart/Ir times the sum of the rated currents of all installed motors. Other impedances. c Capacitors A shunt capacitor bank located near the fault location will discharge, thus increasing the shortcircuit current. This damped oscillatory discharge is characterised by a high initial peak value that is superposed on the initial peak of the shortcircuit current, even though its frequency is far greater than that of the network. Depending on the timing between the initiation of the fault and the voltage wave, two extreme cases must be considered: v If the initiation of the fault coincides with zero voltage, the short-circuit discharge current is asymmetrical, with a maximum initial amplitude peak v Conversely, if the initiation of the fault coincides with maximum voltage, the discharge current superposes itself on the initial peak of the fault current, which, because it is symmetrical, has a low value It is therefore unlikely, except for very powerful capacitor banks, that superposition will result in an initial peak higher than the peak current of an asymmetrical fault. It follows that when calculating the maximum short-circuit current, capacitor banks do not need to be taken into account. However, they must nonetheless be considered when selecting the type of circuit breaker. During opening, capacitor banks significantly reduce the circuit frequency and thus affect current interruption. c Switchgear 14 Certain devices (circuit breakers, contactors with blow-out coils, direct thermal relays, etc.) have an impedance that must be taken into account, for the calculation of Isc, when such a device is located upstream of the device intended to break the given short-circuit and remain closed (selective circuit breakers). 15 For LV circuit breakers, for example, a reactance value of 0.15 mΩ is typical, while the resistance is negligible. For breaking devices, a distinction must be made depending on the speed of opening: v Certain devices open very quickly and thus significantly reduce short-circuit currents. This is the case for fast-acting, limiting circuit breakers and the resultant level of electrodynamic forces and thermal stresses, for the part of the installation concerned, remains far below the theoretical maximum v Other devices, such as time-delayed circuit breakers, do not offer this advantage c Fault arc The short-circuit current often flows through an arc at the fault location. The resistance of the arc is considerable and highly variable. The voltage drop over a fault arc can range from 100 to 300 V. For HV applications, this drop is negligible with respect to the network voltage and the arc has no effect on reducing the short-circuit current. For LV applications, however, the actual fault current when an arc occurs is limited to a much lower level than that calculated (bolted, solid fault), because the voltage is much lower. 16 For example, the arc resulting from a shortcircuit between conductors or busbars may reduce the prospective short-circuit current by 20 to 50% and sometimes by even more than 50% for nominal voltages under 440 V. However, this phenomenon, highly favourable in the LV field and which occurs for 90% of faults, may not be taken into account when determining the breaking capacity because 10% of faults take place during closing of a device, producing a solid Fig. 19 : Synchronous compensator and motor reactance values, in per unit.

This phenomenon should, however, be taken into account for the calculation of the minimum short-circuit current. c Various impedances Other elements may add non-negligible impedances. This is the case for harmonics filters and inductors used to limit the short-circuit current. They must, of course, be included in calculations, as well as wound-primary type current transformers for which the impedance values vary depending on the rating and the type of construction. expressed in %. Z 1 Sn MR = x 100 c For the system as a whole, after having calculated all the relative impedances, the shortcircuit power may be expressed as: Ssc ZR = 1 Σ from which it is possible to deduce the fault current Isc at a point with a voltage U: Ι Σ sc = Ssc 3 U 1 3 U ZR = ΣZR is the composed vector sum of all the impedances related to elements upstream of the fault. It is therefore the relative impedance of the upstream network as seen from a point at U voltage. Hence, Ssc is the short-circuit power, in VA, at a point where voltage is U. For example, if we consider the simplified diagram of Figure 20 : At point A, Ssc = U Z U U Z LV T LV HV L 2 2       + Hence, Ssc = 1 Z U Z U T HV 2 L LV 2 + Fig. 20 : Calculating Ssc at point A. UHT ZT UBT ZC A 2.3 Relationships between impedances at the different voltage levels in an installation Impedances as a function of the voltage The short-circuit power Ssc at a given point in the network is defined by: Ssc = U 3 U Zsc 2 Ι = This means of expressing the short-circuit power implies that Ssc is invariable at a given point in the network, whatever the voltage. And the equation Ιsc U 3 Zsc 3 = implies that all impedances must be calculated with respect to the voltage at the fault location, which leads to certain complications that often produce errors in calculations for networks with two or more voltage levels. For example, the impedance of a HV line must be multiplied by the square of the reciprocal of the transformation ratio, when calculating a fault on the LV side of the transformer: 17 Z Z U U BT HT BT HT =       2 A simple means of avoiding these difficulties is the relative impedance method proposed by H. Rich. Calculation of the relative impedances This is a calculation method used to establish a relationship between the impedances at the different voltage levels in an electrical installation. This method proposes dividing the impedances (in ohms) by the square of the network line-toline voltage (in volts) at the point where the impedances exist. The impedances therefore become relative (ZR). c For overhead lines and cables, the relative resistances and reactances are defined as: R R U and X X U CR 2 CR 2 = = with R and X in ohms and U in volts. c For transformers, the impedance is expressed on the basis of their short-circuit voltages usc and their kVA rating Sn: Z 1 Sn TR s = u c 100 c For rotating machines, the equation is identical, with x representing the impedanc Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.19 2.4 Calculation example (with the impedances of the power sources, the upstream network and the power supply transformers as well as those of the electrical lines) Problem Consider a 20 kV network that supplies a HV / LV substation via a 2 km overhead line, and a 1 MVA generator that supplies in parallel the busbars of the same substation. Two 1,000 kVA parallel-connected transformers supply the LV busbars which in turn supply 20 outgoers to 20 motors, including the one supplying motor M. All motors are rated 50 kW, all connection cables are identical and all motors are running when the fault occurs. The Isc3 and ip values must be calculated at the various fault locations indicated in the network diagram (see Fig. 21 ), that is: c Point A on the HV busbars, with a negligible impedance c Point B on the LV busbars, at a distance of 10 meters from the transformers c Point C on the busbars of an LV subdistribution board c Point D at the terminals of motor M Then the reverse current of the motors must be calculated at C and B, then at D and A.

What is more, if the fault arc is taken into account (see § c fault arc section 16 ), IB is reduced to a maximum value of 28,000 A and a minimum value of 17,500 A .

V - Reverse currents of the motors It is often faster to simply consider the motors as independent generators, injecting into the fault a “reverse current” that is superimposed on the network fault current. c Fault at C The current produced by the motor may be calculated on the basis of the “motor + cable” impedance: XM 605 2.7 10 608 m 3 = + ( ) ≈ − Ω R 10 M m -3 = + (121 19 3 140 . ) ≈ Ω ZM = 624 mΩ hence ΙM x x = ≈ − 410 3 624 10 379 3 A For the 20 motors ΙMC = 7,580 A. Instead of making the above calculations, it is possible (see 13 ) to estimate the current injected by all the motors as being equal to (Istart / Ir) times their rated current (98 A), i.e. (4.8 x 98) x 20 = 9,400 A.

Consequently, the short-circuit current (subtransient) on the LV busbars increases from 11,400 A to 19,000 A and ipC from 20,200 A to 36,400 A. c Fault at D The impedance to be taken into account is 1 / 19th of ZM (19 parallel motors), plus that of the cable.

Again, it is possible to estimate the current injected by all the motors as being equal to 4.8 times their rated current (98 A), i.e. 9,400 A. The approximation again overestimates the real value of IMB. Using the fact that R / X = 0.24 = κ = 1.5 i pMB =×× = 15 2 7 . ,440 15,800 A . Taking the motors into account, the short-circuit current (subtransient) on the main LV switchboard increases from 35,070 A to 42,510 A and the peak ipB from 72,400 A to 88,200 A. However, as mentioned above, if the fault arc is taken into account, IB is reduced between 21.3 to 34 kA. c Fault at A (HV side) Rather than calculating the equivalent impedances, it is easier to estimate (conservatively) the reverse current of the motors at A by multiplying the value at B by the LV / HV transformation value 17 , i.e.: 7,440 410 20 10 152.5 A 3 × × = This figure, compared to the 6,415 A calculated previously, is negligible Rough calculation of the fault at D This calculation makes use of all the approximations mentioned above (notably 15 and 16 .

Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.23 3 Calculation of Isc values in a radial network using symmetrical components 3.1 Advantages of this method Calculation using symmetrical components is particularly useful when a three-phase network is unbalanced, because, due to magnetic phenomena, for example, the traditional “cyclical” impedances R and X are, normally speaking, no longer useable. This calculation method is also required when: c A voltage and current system is not symmetrical (Fresnel vectors with different moduli and imbalances exceeding 120°).This is the case for phase-to-earth or phase-to-phase short-circuits with or without earth connection c The network includes rotating machines and/or special transformers (Yyn connection, for example) This method may be used for all types of radial distribution networks at all voltage levels. 3.2 Symmetrical components Similar to the Leblanc theorem which states that a rectilinear alternating field with a sinusoidal amplitude is equivalent to two rotating fields turning in the opposite direction, the definition of symmetrical components is based on the equivalence between an unbalanced threephase system and the sum of three balanced threephase systems, namely the positivesequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence (see Fig. 23 ). The superposition principle may then be used to calculate the fault currents. In the description below, the system is defined using current Ι1 as the rotation reference, where: c Ι1(1) is the positive-sequence component c Ι1(2) is the negative-sequence component c Ι1 (0) is the zero-sequence component and by using the following operator a = e = - 1 2 j 3 2 j 2 3 π + between I1, I2, and I3. This principle, applied to a current system, is confirmed by a graphical representation (see fig. 23). For example, the graphical addition of the vectors produces, for, the following result: Ι Ι ΙΙ 2 1 = ++ a a 1 1 2 (1) (2) (3) . Currents Ι1and Ι3 may be expressed in the same manner, hence the system: ΙΙ Ι Ι 1 1 =+ + (1) (2) (0) a 1 1 Ι Ι ΙΙ 2 1 = ++ a a 1 1 2 (1) (2) (0) Ι Ι ΙΙ 3 1 = a + a 1 + 1 (1) (2) (0) 2 .

Among these characteristics, we can note that Z(2) ≈ Z(1), except for rotating machines, whereas Z(0) varies depending on each element (see Fig. 24 ). For further information on this subject, a detailed presentation of this method for calculating solid and impedance fault currents is contained in the “Cahier Technique” n° 18 (see the appended bibliography). 3.3 Calculation as defined by IEC 60909 Standard IEC 60909 defines and presents a method implementing symmetrical components, that may be used by engineers not specialised in the field. The method is applicable to electrical networks with a nominal voltage of less than 550 kV and the standard explains the calculation of minimum and maximum short-circuit currents. The former is required in view of calibrating overcurrent protection devices and the latter is used to determine the rated characteristics for the electrical equipment. Procedure 1- Calculate the equivalent voltage at the fault location, equal to c Un / 3 where c is a voltage factor required in the calculation to account for: c Voltage variations in space and in time c Possible changes in transformer tappings c Subtransient behaviour of generators and motors Depending on the required calculations and the given voltage levels, the standardised voltage levels are indicated in Figure 25 . 2- Determine and add up the equivalent positivesequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence impedances upstream of the fault location. 3- Calculate the initial short-circuit current using the symmetrical components. Practically speaking and depending on the type of fault, the equations required for the calculation of the Isc are indicated in the table in Figure 26 . 4- Once the rms value of the initial short-circuit current (I" k) is known, it is possible to calculate the other values: ip, peak value, Ib, rms value of the symmetrical short-circuit breaking current, idc, aperiodic component, Ik, rms value of the steady-state short-circuit current. Effect of the distance separating the fault from the generator When using this method, two different possibilities must always be considered: c The short-circuit is far from the generator, the situation in networks where the short-circuit currents do not have a damped, alternating component This is generally the case in LV networks, except when high-power loads are supplied by special HV substations; c The short-circuit is near the generator (see fig. 11), the situation in networks where the short-circuit currents do have a damped, alternating component. This generally occurs in HV systems, but may occur in LV systems when, for example, an emergency generator supplies priority outgoers.

Conditions to consider when calculating the maximum and minimum short-circuit currents c Calculation of the maximum short-circuit currents must take into account the following points v Application of the correct voltage factor c corresponding to calculation of the maximum short-circuit currents v Among the assumptions and approximations mentioned in this document, only those leading to a conservative error should be used v The resistances per unit length RL of lines (overhead lines, cables, phase and neutral conductors) should be calculated for a temperature of 20 °C c Calculation of the minimum short-circuit currents requires v Applying the voltage factor c corresponding to the minimum permissible voltage on the network v Selecting the network configuration, and in some cases the minimum contribution from sources and network feeders, which result in the lowest short-circuit current at the fault location v Taking into account the impedance of the busbars, the current transformers, etc. v Considering resistances RL at the highest foreseeable temperature R C L e - 20 C x RL20 . = + ° ( ° )       1 0 004 θ where RL20 is the resistance at 20 °C; θe is the permissible temperature (°C) for the conductor at the end of the short-circuit.

Peak short-circuit current ip Peak value ip of the short-circuit current In no meshed systems, the peak value ip of the shortcircuit current may be calculated for all types of faults using the equation: i 2 p k " = κ Ι where I" k = is the initial short-circuit current, κ = is a factor depending on the R / X and can be calculated approximately using the following equation (see fig.9) : κ = 1.02 + 0.98 e -3R X Short-circuit breaking current Ib Calculation of the short-circuit breaking current Ib is required only when the fault is near the generator and protection is ensured by timedelayed circuit breakers. Note that this current is used to determine the breaking capacity of these circuit breakers. This current may be calculated with a fair degree of accuracy using the following equation: Ib = µ . I" k where: where µ = is a factor defined by the minimum time delay tmin and the I" k / Ir ratio (see Fig. 27 ) which expresses the influence of the subtransient and transient reactances, with Ir as the rated current of the generator. Steady-state short-circuit current Ik The amplitude of the steady-state short-circuit current Ik depends on generator saturation influences and calculation is therefore less accurate than for the initial symmetrical curren I" k. The proposed calculation methods produce a sufficiently accurate estimate of the upper and lower limits, depending on whether the shortcircuit is supplied by a generator or a synchronous machine. c The maximum steady-state short-circuit current, with the synchronous generator at its highest excitation, may be calculated by: Ikmax = λmax Ir c The minimum steady-state short-circuit current is calculated under no-load, constant (minimum) excitation conditions for the synchronous generator and using the equation: Ikmin = λmin Ir λ is a factor defined by the saturated synchronous reactance Xd sat. The λmax and λmin values are indicated on next the page in Figure 28 for turbo-generators and in Figure 29 for machines with salient poles (series 1 in IEC 60909).

A number of these methods were initially designed in such a way that short-circuit currents could be calculated by hand or using a small calculator. Over the years, the standards have been revised and the methods have often been modified to provide greater accuracy and a better representation of reality. However, in the process, they have become more complicated and time-consuming, as is demonstrated by the recent changes in IEC 60909, where hand calculations are possible only for the most simple cases. With the development of ever more sophisticated computerised calculations, electrical-installation designers have developed software meeting their particular needs. Today, a number of software packages comply with the applicable standards, for example Ecodial, a program designed for low-voltage installations and marketed by Schneider Electric. All computer programs designed to calculate short-circuit currents are predominantly concerned with: c Determining the required breaking and making capacities of switchgear and the electromechanical withstand capabilities of equipment c Determining the settings for protection relays and fuse ratings to ensure a high level of discrimination in the electrical network Other software is used by experts specialising in electrical network design, for example to study the dynamic behaviour of electrical networks. Such computer programs can be used for precise simulations of electrical phenomena over time and their use is now spreading to include the entire electro-mechanical behaviour of networks and installations. Remember, however, that all software, whatever its degree of sophistication, is only a tool. To ensure correct results, it should be used by qualified professionals who have acquired the relevant knowledge and experience.

Although their backgrounds and professional skills are similar, chemical engineers work in a wide variety of industries, in addition to chemicals and petroleum, such as: Biotechnology Lime and cement Consulting Man-made fibers Drugs and pharmaceuticals Metallurgical and metal products Fats and oils Paints, varnishes, and pigments Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals Pesticides and herbicides Environment Waste water treatment All the industries as mentioned above are involving numerous of chemical process unit. Therefore, chemical engineers play an important role on design, operation, control, troubleshooting, research and management in the chemical process. Chemical process is a combination of process equipment designed to efficiently convert raw materials into finished or intermediate products. Figure 1 shows the example of chemical processes converting the raw material into desired product. Figure 1.1: Chemical process 1.2 Units and Dimensions “What are units and dimensions and how do they differ?” Dimensions are basic concepts of measurement such as length (L), mass (M), time (t), temperature (T), amount of substance (n) and so on. Besides, units are the mean of expressing the dimensions as feet or centimeters for length, or hours or seconds for time. By attaching units to all numbers that are not fundamentally dimensionless, you are able to easy interrelating the physical meaning to the numbers use. Moreover, a logical 1 approach to the problem rather than remembering a formula and plugging numbers could also help the chemical engineers in engineering calculation.

The atomic weights of all the elements in their naturally isotopic proportions are listed in the table given. The molecular weight of a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms that constitute a molecule of the compound: For example atomic oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16 and therefore molecular oxygen (O2) has a molecular weight of approximately 32. A gram-mole (g-mole or mol in SI units) of a 9 species is the amount of that species whose mass in grams is numerically equal to its molecular weight. Hence, one g-mole of any species co Avogadro’s number) molecules of that species. ntains approximately 6.02x1023 example, and therefore there is 454 ol/lb-mole, regardless of the substance involved. xample 1.7 ow many of each of the following are contained in 100g of CO2 (M=44.01)? i.

Thus, iii. mol C 2.273 mol C ( Moreover, there are other types of moles such as kg-moles, lb-moles, and ton-moles. For example: Carbon monoxide (CO) has a molecular weight of 28; 1 mol of CO therefore contains 28g, 1 lb-mole contains 28 lbm, 1 ton-mole contains 28 tons and so on. Besides, the same factors used to convert masses from a unit to another can also be used to convert the equivalent molar units: there is 454 g/lb for m 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 E H = 2.273 m l CO o 2 1 lb-mol Each molecules of CO2 contains one atom of C, one molecule of O2 or two atoms of O.

They are almost always prerequisite to all other calculations in the solution of process engineering problems. Material balances are nothing more than the application of the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed. Thus, as an example, you cannot specify an input to a reactor of one ton of naphtha and an output of two tons of gasoline or gases or anything else. One ton of total material in o A material balance is an accounting for material. Thus, material balances are often compared to the balancing of current accounts.

Between t0 and tf no ammonia enters or leaves through the reactor boundaries, so general balance equation (1) is simply generation = accumulation. Moreover, the quantity of ammonia that builds up (accumulates) in the reactor between t0 and tf is simply nf – n0, the final amount minus the initial amount.

The phase diagram shows, in pressure-temperature space, 41 the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas. The phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the critical point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable, in what is known as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around Tc=647.096 K (1,164.773 °R), pc=22.064 MPa (3,200.1 psi) and ρc=356 kg/m³.

Change in P, at constant T & constant state of aggregation. 2. Change in T, at constant T & constant state of aggregation. 3. Phase changes at constant T & constant P. 4. Mixing at constant T & constant P. 5. Chemical reaction at constant T & constant P. 4.2 Hypothetical Process Path ` State properties o Properties that depend on the state of the species (primarily on its temperature and state of aggregation, and to lesser extent on its pressure). o Specific enthalpy ( Hˆ ) and specific internal energy ( Uˆ ) are state properties species. o When a species passes from one state to another state, both Δ Hˆ and ΔUˆ for the process are independent of the path taken from the first state to the second state. ` We can construct a hypothetical process path which can consist of several step based on our convenience, as long as we reach to the final state starting from their initial state. ` For example, the enthalpy change (Δ Hˆ ) of solid phenol at 25 o C and 1 atm to phenol vapor at 300 o C and 3 atm. H phenol Δ ˆ = (vapor, 300˚C, 3 atm) – (solid, 25˚C, 1 atm) o Cannot determine directly from enthalpy table – must use hypothetical process path consist of several step. o Check Table of Physical Properties Data Appendix 5: P= 1 atm; Tm= 42.5°C and Tb= 181.4°C 46 1 2 3 4 5 6 Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ=Δ HHHHHHH ˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ 4.3 Procedure Energy Balance Calculations 1. Perform all required material balance calculations. 2. Write the appropriate form of the energy balance (closed or open system) and delete any of the terms that are either zero or negligible for the given process system. 3. Choose a reference state – phase, temperature, and pressure – for each species involved in the process. 4. Construct inlet-outlet table for specific internal energy (close system) or specific enthalpy (close system) { For closed system, construct a Table with columns for initial and final amounts of each species (mi or ni) and specific internal energies (Uˆ ) relative to the chosen reference states. { For an open system, construct a table with columns for inlet and outlet stream component flow rates (mi or ni) and specific enthalpies ( Hˆ ) relative to the chosen references states. 5. Calculate all required values of Hˆ or Uˆ and insert the values in the appropriate places in the table. Then calculate Δ Hˆ or ΔUˆ for the system. 6. Calculate any work, kinetic energy, or potential energy terms that you have not dropped from the energy balance. 7.

Heat transfer is thermal energy in transit due to a temperature difference. In other words, heat transfer is to predict the energy transfer between material bodies. [In the simplest of terms, the discipline of heat transfer is concerned with only two things: temperature, and the flow of heat. Temperature represents the amount of thermal energy available, whereas heat flow represents the movement of thermal energy from place to place.] o How Science of heat transfer explain: ¾ How heat energy may be transfer? ¾ Predict the rate at which the exchange will take place? ¾ Different between thermodynamics and heat transfer ? o Thermodynamics deal with system in equilibrium, it may used to predict of energy required to change a system from one equilibrium state to another. But it does not predict how fast a change will take place. Example 6.1 Consider the cooling of a hot steel bar which is placed in a pail of water. Thermodynamics may used to predict the final equilibrium temperature of steel bar-water combination. However, thermodynamics will not tell: ¾ how long to reach the equilibrium or, ¾ what the temperature of steel bar after certain length of time? 67 Table 6.1: Comparison between heat transfer and thermodynamics HEAT TRANSFER THERMODYNAMICS • Heat transfer is a study which predicts the energy transfer which takes place between material bodies. • It is due to the temperature difference • Heat transfer explains how heat energy may be transferred. • It also predicts the rate at which the exchange will take place under certain condition. • Thermodynamics deals with systems in equilibrium. • Thermodynamics may used to predict the amount of energy required to change a system from one equilibrium state to another. • Thermodynamics may not used to predict how fast a change will take place since the system is not in equilibrium during the process. Three modes of heat transfer are: (1) Conduction (2) Convection (3) Radiation 6.2 Conduction Heat Transfer o Energy transfer from high temperature region to low temperature region. We said that the energy is transferred by conduction. And, the heat transfer rate per unit area is proportional to the normal temperature gradient. q/A ~ dT/dx where, q/A = heat transfer rate (W/m2 ) dT/dx = temperature gradient in the direction of the heat flow When proportionality constant is inserted, q = - kA dT/dx [6.1] o The positive constant k = thermal conductivity of the material. The minus (-) sign is inserted so that the second principle of thermodynamics will be satisfied i.e. heat must flow downhill on the temperature scale as indicated in Figure 6.1. 68 Equation (8.0) is called Fourier’s Law of heat conduction. Above is defining equation for the thermal conductivity and k has the unit of Watts per meter per Celsius degree (W/m.0 C), which the heat flow is expressed in watts. Figure 6.1: Sketch showing direction of heat flow Table 6.2: Lists typical values of the thermal conductivities of some metal (thermal conductivity at 300 K(W/m K)). Metal k Copper, pure 396 Aluminium 238 Carbon steel, 1% C 42 Plastics 0.2 - 0.3 Air 0.026 69 Figure 6.2: One –dimensional plane wall o Consider the one-dimensional plane wall shown in Figure above, if the system in a steady state, i.e., if the temperature does not change with time, then only integrate Equation (8.0) and substitute the appropriate values. 1 0 2 x T T q dx kdT A = ∫ ∫ o Where temperature at the left face (x=0) is uniform at T1 and the temperature at right face is uniform at T2. If k is independent of T, we obtain after integration : 2 q T T 1 k A L − = − o Under the steady state conditions, where the distribution is linear, the temperature gradient may be expressed as: T T 2 1 dT dx L − = o And the heat transfer rate: T T 2 1 q k A L − = − or; T T 1 2 q T k k A L L − Δ = = 70 o Since dT/dx = - q/k for the same q, if k is low (i.e: for an insulator), dT/dx will be large .i.e. there will be a large temperature difference across the wall, and if k is high (i.e. for a conductor), dT/dx will be small, or there will be a small temperature difference across the wall. Example 6.2 One face of a copper plate 3 cm thick is maintained at 400 °C, and the other face maintained at 100 °C. How much heat is transferred through the plate? Given: k = 370 W/m.K. From Fourier’s Law, q d k A d = − T x Integrating gives ( ) 2 370 / . (100 400) 3 10 q T W mK K k A x m− Δ − − =− = Δ × q/A = 3.7 MW/m 2 6.3 Convection Heat Transfer o It is well known that hot plate of metal will cool faster when placed in front of a fan than when exposed to still air. We say that, heat is convected away, and we call the process, convection heat transfer. The velocity at which the air blows over the hot plate obviously influence the heat transfer rate. 6.3.1 Mechanism of convection o Consider the heated plate shown on Figure 8.3. Temperature of plate is Tw and temperature of the fluid is T∞. The velocity of the flow will appear as shown in the figure. 71 Figure 6.3: Convection heat transfer from a plate o The velocity is being reduced to zero at the plate as a result of viscous action. Since the velocity of fluid layer at the wall will be zero, the heat must be transferred only by conduction. Thus we might compute the heat transfer, using: q = -kA (dT/dx) but with little changes. We use thermal conductivity of fluid and the fluid temperature gradient at the wall.The temperature gradient is dependent on the rate at which the fluid carries the heat away. High velocity produces a large temperature gradient. Thus, the temperature gradient at the wall depends on the flow field. To express the overall effect of convection, we use Newton’s law of cooling: q = hA (Tw-T∞) [6.2] where, h = convection heat-transfer coefficient (heat-transfer coefficient = film conductance) h = watt per square meter per Celsius degree (W/m² .°C) when the heat flow is in Watt. o Heat-transfer rate is related to overall temperature difference between the wall and fluid and the surface area. 6.3.2 Free and Forced Convection o If heated plate were exposed to ambient room air without an external source of motion, a movement of the air would be experienced as a result of the density gradients near the plate. o We call this as free convection. When the mass motion of the fluid is caused by an external device like a pump, compressor, blower or fan, the process is called forced convection. Example 6.3 72 Air at 20 °C blows over a hot plate 50 by 75 cm maintained at 250 °C. The convection heat transfer coefficient is 25 W/m².°C. Calculate the heat transfer? Solution: From Newton’s Law of cooling; ( ) w q hA T T = − ∞ q = (25)W/m2 .K (0.5x0.75) m2 (250-20)K q = 2.156 kW Example 6.4 An electric current is passed through a wire 1 mm in diameter and 10 cm long. The wire is submerged in liquid water at atmospheric pressure, and the current is increased until the water boils. For this situation h = 5000 W/m².°C, and the water temperature will be 100 °C. How much electric power must be supplied to the wire to maintain the wire surface at 114 °C. Solution: Total convection loss is ( ) w q hA T T = − ∞ The surface area of the wire A = πdL = π (1x10 -3 )(10x10 -2 ) = 3.142 x 10 -4 m 2 Therefore, the heat transfer is q = (5000w/m².°C)(3.142 x 10 -4 m²)(114-100) = 21.99 W and this is equal to the electric power which must be applied. 6.4 Radiation Heat Transfer o Heat may also transfer through regions where perfect vacuum exist. The mechanism in this case is electromagnetic radiation which is propagated as a result of a temperature difference. This is called thermal radiation. o This is confirmed by our experienced everyday experience of being warmed by the sun, which separated from the earth by approximately 1.5 x 1011 m of empty space. o Thermal radiation can of course transport through any ‘transparent’ medium such as air. Ideal thermal radiator, or black body, will emit energy at a rate 73 q emitted = σAT4 [6.3] where; σ is the proportionality constant and is called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant with value of 5.669 x 10 -8 W/m 2 .K 4 . o This equation is called Stefan-Boltzmann law of thermal radiation and it apply to only blackbodies. This equation is valid only for thermal radiation; other type of electromagnetic radiation may not be treated so simply. q emitted = σAT4 govern only radiation emitted by a blackbody. The net radian exchange between two surface will be proportional to the difference in absolute temperature to the fourth power. i.e: q net exchange/ A  (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) q net exchange/ A = σ (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) 6.4.1 Blackbody o It is a perfect emitter of radiation. At a particular temperature the blackbody would emit the maximum amount of energy possible for that temperature. o This value is known as the blackbody radiation. It would emit at every wavelength of light as it must be able to absorb every wavelength to be sure of absorbing all incoming radiation. o The maximum wavelength emitted by a blackbody radiator is infinite. It also emits a definite amount of energy at each wavelength for a particular temperature, so standard black body radiation curves can be drawn for each temperature, showing the energy radiated at each wavelength (Fig. 6.4). 74 Figure 6.4: Theoretical black body curve for 5000K o Again, blackbody is a body which radiates energy according to the T 4 law. Other type of surface, such as glossy painted surface or a polished metal plate, do not radiate as much energy as the blackbody. o However, the total radiation emitted by this body still generally follows the T1 4 proportionality. To take account of the “gray” nature of such surfaces we introduce another factor, called the emissivity,  which relates the radiation of the “gray” surface to that of an ideal black surface. In addition, we must take into account the fact that not all the radiation leaving one surface will reach the other surface since electromagnetic radiation travels in straight line and some will lost to the surrounding. o Therefore two new factors in (Eq 8.2)take into account both situation, so that q= F F G σ A (T1 4 - T 2 4 ) [6.4] F = emissivity function F G = geometric “view factor” function A simple radiation problem is encounter when we have a heat-transfer surface at temperature T1 completely enclosed by much larger surface maintained at T2. The net radiant exchange in this case can be calculated with, q =  1 Aσ 1 (T 4 1 - T 4 2 ) where,  1 = emissivity of material Example 6.5 Two infinite black plates at 800 0 C and 300 0 C exchange heat by radiation. Calculate the heat transfer per unit area. Given: σ = 5.669 x 10 -8 W/m 2 .K 4 Solution: q/A = σ (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) = 5.669 X 10 -8 )W/m 2 .K 4 (10734 - 5734)K 4 = 69.03 kW/m 2 75 Problems 1. If 3 kW is conducted through a section of insulating material 0.6 m2 in crosssection and 2.5 cm thick and the thermal conductivity may be taken as 0.2 W/m0 C, compute the temperature difference across the material. 2. A temperature difference of 850 C is impressed across a fiberglass layer of 13 cm thickness. The thermal conductivity of the fiberglass is 0.035 W/m.0 C. Compute the heat transferred through the material per hour per unit area. 3. Two perfectly black surfaces are constructed so that all the radiant energy leaving a surface at 8000 C reaches the other surface. The temperature of the other surface is maintained at 2500 C. Calculate the heat transfer between the surfaces per hour and per unit area of the surface maintained at 8000 C. 4. One side of a plane wall is maintained at 100 C, while the other side is exposed to a convection having T = 100 C and h=10 W/m2.0 C. The wall has k = 1.6 W/m.0 C and is 40 cm thick. Calculate the heat transfer rate through the wall. 0 5. A vertical square plate, 30cm on a side, is maintained at 500 C and exposed to room air at 200 C. The surface emissivity is 0.8. Calculate the total heat lost by both sides of the plate. CHAPTER 7 HEAT EXCHANGERS 7.1 Introduction A heat exchanger is a device that facilitates exchange of heat between two fluids that are at different temperatures and separated by a solid wall. In other words, heat exchangers are devices built for efficient heat transfer from one fluid to another and are widely used in engineering processes. The specific applications of heat exchanger are space heating and air conditioning, power production, waste heat recovery, food and chemical processing, oil refining, and in vehicles. 76 7.2 Heat exchanger types Heat exchangers are classified according to flow arrangement and type of construction. Six (6) types of heat exchanger are: (a) Concentric Tube Heat Exchangers (b) Cross-Flow Heat Exchangers (c) Cross-counter Flow (Coil) Heat Exchangers (d) Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers (e) Compact Heat Exchangers (f) Plate-Type Heat Exchangers (a) Concentric Tube Heat Exchanger ƒ It also called double-pipe heat exchangers or co-axial flow heat exchangers [Figure 7.1]. ƒ One fluid flows inside the tube and the other fluid flows inside the annulus. ƒ In parallel-flow heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end, and travel in parallel to exit at the other side. [Figure7.2a] ƒ In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. Counter current design is more efficient, in that it can transfer more heat [Figure 7.2b]. Figure 7.1: Concentric tube heat exchangers (a) Parallel flow (b) Counterflow Figure 7.2: Concentric tube heat exchangers 77 (b) Cross Flow Heat Exchanger ƒ In a cross-flow heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger. ƒ In finned tubular heat exchangers, the fin-side fluid is unmixed because the fins confine the flow to one direction. Example: automobile radiator. ƒ In unfinned tubular heat exchangers, the fin-side fluid is mixed because the flow in transverse direction is possible. [Figure 7.3] ƒ The use of fins to improve the convection coefficient of fin-side fluid by increasing the outside surface area. Figure 7.3: Cross-flow heat exchangers (c) Cross-counter Flow (Coil) Heat Exchangers (a) Finned with both fluids unmixed (b) Unfinned with one fluid mixed and the other unmixed 78 Figure 7.4: Cross-counter Flow (Coil) Heat Exchangers (d) Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers ƒ Tubular heat exchangers consist of a tube bank enclosed by a shell. One fluid flows inside the tubes and the other flows inside the shell. ƒ Figure 8.5, show the simplest form of shell and tube heat exchanger which involves single tube and shell passes. ƒ Figure 7.5: Shell and tube heat exchanger with one-shell pass one-tube pass (1-1) (a) Two-pass (b) Four-pass (cross-counterflow mode of operation) ƒ Baffles are usually installed to increase the convection coefficient of the shell-side fluid by inducing turbulence and a cross-flow velocity component. 79 ƒ Baffled heat exchanger with one shell pass and two tube passes and with two shell passes and four tube passes are shown in Figures 7.6a and 7.6b, respectively. Figure 7.6: Shell-and-tube heat exchanger. (a) One shell pass and two tube passes. (b) Two shell passes and four tube passes ƒ Shell-and-tube heat exchangers are classified according to the number of shell and tube passes involved. ƒ Heat exchangers in which all the tubes make one U-turn in the shell, for example, are called one-shell-pass and two-tube-passes heat exchangers. ƒ Heat exchanger that involves two passes in the shell and four passes in the tubes is called a two-shell-passes and four-tube-passes heat exchanger [Figure 7.7] 80 (a) One-shell pass and two-tube passes (b) Two-shell passes and four-tube passes Figure 7.7: Multipass flow arrangement in shell-and-tube heat exchangers (e) Compact Heat Exchanger ƒ Used to achieve very large heat transfer area per unit volume. ƒ Have dense arrays of finned tubes or plates. ƒ Typically used when at least one of the fluids is a gas, characterized by small convection coefficient. ƒ The tubes may be flat or circular, and the fins may be plate or circular (Figure 7.8a, 7.8b and 7.8c). ƒ Parallel plates may be finned or corrugated and may be used in single-pass or multi-pass mode (Figure 7.8d and 7.8e). 81 Figure 7.8: Compact heat exchanger cores.

Calculate the area required for this exchanger, assuming that the overall heat-transfer coefficient remains at 320 W/m2 . 0 C. Solution: To solve this problem we determine a correction factor from Figure x to be used with the LMTF calculated on the basis of a counterflow exchanger.

Cassette based document handling system
Abstract
A cassette (20) for a currency handling system includes a door (28) that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the cassette. An end door (30) is operable to be opened to allow currency that is disposed within the interior of the cassette (20) to be urged outward. The cassette (20) has a locking mechanism disposed in an end (72), which locking mechanism prevents the door from opening until the cassette (20) is disposed in a docking station. Once in the docking station, a paddle (56) is urged downward into the cassette (20) to urge the notes outward therefrom. These notes are moved into a buffer region (58) and then the cassette (20) can be removed to allow another cassette (20) to be disposed therein. This allows a continuous feeding operation. The cassette (20) can then be disposed in a second collection docking station to collect the output of the sorter (41). In this docking station, a paddle (68) is reciprocated downward into the cassette (20) with the collected notes.

Description
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention pertains in general to a document handling system and, more particularly, to a currency handling system that utilizes a cassette for transporting currency between stations.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
After currency is distributed in the public sector, it will typically find its way back into the banking institutions. This is facilitated through individuals depositing currency documents in their local banking institutions, and businesses forwarding their cash receipts to the banking institutions. Once the banking institutions have received the currency in the form of the notes, these notes must then be processed. Although the processing can be facilitated by hand, this is somewhat tedious. To facilitate the large number of notes that must be sorted, counted and then re-bundled or "strapped" for distribution back to the banks, large high speed currency sorting machines have been developed.
Currency sorting machines typically have a feeder slot into which stacks of currency in different denominations and even different sizes can be placed. The currency sorter will then individually strip the notes or documents from the feeder slot, pass them through various sensing stations to determine the denomination of the note and even the quality or integrity of the note. Once this is done, then the sorting machine will deposit the note in a collection slot associated with the proper denomination. Typically, a separate collection slot is provided for notes that are defective due to, for example, a tear or excessive wear. These sorting machines can sort notes at rates up to 2,000 notes per minute.
The disadvantage to present sorting systems is the manner in which the notes must be transported between stations. Typically, there are three stations, the first being the initial hand sorting or collection operation at the original banking institution, the second being the feeder operation to the sorter and the third being the collection operation at the sorter. Due to the high speed nature of the sorter, the sorter typically outstrips the speed at which the documents can be placed into the sorter and then removed from the sorter. Therefore, there exists a need for a system that will facilitate an increase in the throughput.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention disclosed and claimed herein comprises a method and apparatus for transferring documents utilizing a portable cassette having a cover that can be opened to expose the documents or closed in a secured and locked manner to prevent access to documents contained therein. The cassette is loaded at a first station in an open configuration to provide a stack of documents therein, and, after loading, the cassette is locked. The loaded cassette is then transported to a second location in the locked configuration, and then disposed in an unloading docking station.
The loaded cassette is opened to expose at least one end of the stack, and then the stack of documents in the loaded cassette is urged out of the loaded cassette through the at least one end into a buffer region that is continually moving. This allows the contents of the cassette to become part of the documents in the buffer region. The cassette is removed after urging the documents therefrom and after the documents have cleared the at least one end. The unloading operation is then continuously repeated with a new loaded cassette.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a diagrammatic view of the process flow for a document handling system of the present invention, which utilizes a cassette for transporting currency. The process flow is provided by three stations, a hand load station 10, a feeder station 12 and a collection station 14. Initially, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, currency is hand loaded into a cassette. Typically, the cassettes are delivered to a banking institution in an open configuration, there being a locking system that allows the cassette to be placed into a closed and secure configuration. These cassettes are stacked in a compact manner such that an operator can remove the open cassette from the stack, place it on what is referred to as a "desktop station" and then proceed to load the currency therein. Typically, the currency is counted at the banking institution by hand, placed in some type of bundle and then disposed in the cassette. There may be some type of separator card with a bar code disposed thereon which can be utilized at the central banking institution for identification. Once the currency is hand loaded into the cassette, the cassette is then closed and placed in a secure configuration. Once it is in this configuration, it cannot be opened until it is placed onto another docking station that has a key system for unlocking the cassette.
After the cassettes are hand loaded and secured, they are then placed on some type of transport or given to an individual that has the responsibility for the transport. The loaded cassettes are then transported to a sorting facility. The sorting facility contains both the feeder station 12 and the collection station 14. Of course, the sorting facility may be in the next room from the hand loading station 10. At the feeder station 12, the loaded cassettes can be sequentially disposed in the feeder station to allow high speed feeding and high speed sorting. Further, as will be described hereinbelow, this is a continuous feeding operation.
In the continuous feeding operation, a cassette is retrieved from the transport mechanism or the stack and placed onto a docking station associated with the feeding station 12. When it is placed on the docking station, this action unlocks the cassette and allows the door for the cassette to be opened and providing access to the contents. Once access is obtained, then the operator configures the feeding station to urge the notes out of the cassettes and into a buffer region. Once all the bills are urged out of cassette and into the buffer region, the cassette can then be removed in an open position and then a new loaded and locked cassette placed therein and the procedure continues.
Once the cassette is placed into the feeder station 12, the bills that are accessed are placed behind the previous notes in the buffer region. Therefore, the interior of the cassette and the buffer region constitute a feeding supply to the sorting system. The urging of the notes out of the cassette is the same operation that urges the notes in the buffer region up into interface with the sorting mechanism. This is a constant operation with the notes continually urged upward into the sorting mechanism, such that when a new cassette is placed into the feeding mechanism, the previous notes are still in the buffer region to provide a "seamless" feeding operation. The notes are fed at approximately 1,500 notes per minute and a typical cassette will contain about 2,000 notes.
The sorting mechanism is operable to retrieve the notes from the feeding mechanism, evaluate those notes for the integrity of the notes, orientation and also the denomination of the notes. The notes are then "slotted" into different collection slots. The open cassettes are placed into a docking station in the collection slot, similar to the docking station in the feeder slot, and then the notes collected therein. Once the notes are collected, the cassette can then be locked and removed for subsequent processing.
Referring now to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a block diagram of desktop station 16 for use in the hand loading station 10. The desktop station 16 is a box that has a tilted receiving surface 18. The tilted receiving surface 18 is operable to receive a cassette 20 on the surface thereof The desktop station 16 has at the lower end of the surface 18 a tilting door 22, which door 22 is operable to cover a locking mechanism (not shown). The door 22 is spring loaded, such that when the cassette 20 is removed, the door 22 will swing closed to cover the locking mechanism. This provides both a protective cover and a technique to ensure that the cassette 20 will be placed on the surface 18 above the locking mechanism, such that it will be on the same plane as the locking mechanism before engaging the locking mechanism.
The cassette 20 is comprised of a left side 24 and a right side 26. A tambour door 28 is disposed on the cassette 20, such that it can be pulled over the top opening of the cassette 20. An end door 30 is provided on one end thereof which is operable to cover an end opening. Therefore, the door 28 can be slidingly moved over the top opening and a portion of the end opening and, in conjunction with the door 30, completely seal the cassette 20. A window 32 is provided on the right side 26 and a window 36 is provided on the left side 24, which windows 32 and 36 are operable to allow a user to view the interior contents thereof to determine if there are notes in the cassette 20 after locking. A sliding compression panel 38 is provided which slides along the length of the interior of the cassette 20 to allow notes 40 which are disposed between the compression panel 38 and the opening to be stacked tightly within the cassette 20. The operation of the cassette 20 and the interior workings thereof will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
In the operation of the desktop station 16, the cassette 20 is operable to the stored in a stacked configuration with other cassettes 20, all the cassettes 20 being in an open configuration in the preferred embodiment. When a user desires to fill one of the cassettes 20, the open cassette 20 is retrieved from its storage area and disposed on the desktop station 16. It is not necessary for the desktop station 16 to have an interfacing locking mechanism that is disposed under the door 22, but this is available and shown in this embodiment. The only purpose for the mechanism under the door 22 is to provide a key mechanism for unlocking the locking mechanism internal to the cassette 20. Again, this will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
The operator, after disposing the cassette 20 on the desktop station 16, then hand loads the notes 40 into the interior of the cassette between the compression panel 38 and the end opening of the cassette 20. Typically, the compression panel 38 can be moved toward the bottom or opposite end from the open end, to provide access to the full capacity of the cassette 20. Once the notes 40 are loaded into the cassette 20 to the desired capacity, which may be the full capacity, the compression panel 38 is moved toward the open end and the closed door 30 to "pack" the notes and the door 28 is then slidingly moved upward toward the end opening proximate the door 30, this motion then locking the cassette 20 if a corresponding key mechanism is not available, otherwise the cassette 20 must be removed from the desktop station 16 to lock the cassette 20. The cassette 20 is then removed from the desktop station 16 and disposed on a transport mechanism for transport to the next station, the feeder station 12.
Referring now to FIG. 3, there is illustrated a perspective view of a sorting mechanism 41, which FIG. 3 does not illustrate the details of the sorting mechanism 41. However, the sorting mechanism 41 is operable to retrieve documents, such as notes, from a point 42 and deliver them to one of two points 44 or 46, only two delivery points noted for simplicity purposes. The sorting mechanism 41 is conventional and known by those skilled in the art.
The sorting mechanism 41 has a feeder docking station for feeding notes to the point 42 and two collection docking stations for receiving notes delivered to the points 44 and 46, respectively. When the cassette 20 is transported from the desktop station 16, after locking thereof, the cassette 20 is then disposed in the feeder docking station, which is comprised of a buffer region 48 and a docking region 50. The docking region 50 has associated therewith a key mechanism, similar to the key mechanism disposed under the door 22 in the desktop station 16 of FIG. 2. It is operable to be disposed in the docking region 50 and the key mechanism engaged, such that the door 28 can now be slidingly moved down toward the unopen end of the cassette 20 to expose all of the notes therein. The door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface to allow the notes 40 within the cassette 20 to be moved to the buffer region 48, the surface of the cassette 20, the surface of the door 30 and the lower surface of the buffer region 48 being coplanar.
It can be seen in the embodiment of FIG. 3 that there are a plurality of notes 54 that are disposed in the buffer region 48. These notes 54 are urged upward toward the point 42 with the use of a "paddle" 56. The paddle 56 is mounted on a feeding mechanism 58, which feeding mechanism 58 is operable to reciprocate the paddle along the length of the docking region 50 and buffer region 48. The paddle 56, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, is operable to be reciprocated upward and moved down into the unopen end of the cassette 20 and then pushed down into the cassette 20. It is only necessary for the paddle 56 to rise up high enough to clear the sides of the cassette 20.
In operation, the embodiment of FIG. 3 is illustrated wherein the notes 54 and the buffer region were previously fed in from prior cassette 20. The paddle 56 therefore had cleared the prior cassette and is fully within the buffer region 48, continually urging the notes 54 upward to the point 42. This urging of the notes 54 upward to the point 42 allows the sorting mechanism to strip the notes off. This stripping operation operates at approximately 1,500 notes per minute. When the new cassette 20 is disposed within the docking region 50, the operator in one embodiment then urges the notes 40 upward against the back surface of the paddle 56 and then moves the paddle 56 out of contact with the notes 54 in the buffer region 48 and then moves it vertically upward from the surface of the feeder station and then urges it downward along the length of the feeder station toward the closed end of the cassette 20 until it is proximate to the bottom of the notes 40. The paddle 56 is then engaged with the bottom of the notes 40, such that the notes 40 and the notes 54 now comprise one stack of notes. The paddle 56 then automatically urges the entire combined stack of notes 40 and 54 upward to the point 42. As soon as sufficient notes have been stripped off the top of the combined stack and the combined stack clears the cassette 20, the cassette 20 can be removed and another cassette provided. During this removal, the cassette 20 is allowed to remain open.
In the next operation, the operator will proceed to the next station, the collection station. In this mode, the cassette 20 is disposed within one of the collection docking stations. Each of the collection docking stations has a buffer region 60 and a docking region 62. The buffer region 60 is typically smaller than the buffer region 48, approximately six inches, but it has a similar key device as the feeder docking station in the event that a closed cassette is disposed therein. Once disposed in the docking region 62, the door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface. A feeding mechanism 64 is provided that runs along the length of both buffer region 60 and docking region 62 and has a paddle 68 associated therewith. The paddle 68 is operable to reciprocate downward from the associated one of the points 44-46 as notes are fed therein and will move downward into the associated cassette 20. Once the sorter has determined that the capacity of the cassette 20 has been reached, i.e., the desired note count, it will discontinue routing notes to that particular collection location. The user will then remove the cassette 20, close the door 28 and then store the notes. Typically, there will be some type of bar code for identification purposes on a particular cassette which can be entered into a computer to provide some type of tracking ability. A reader could be implemented for automatically reading the bar code as the cassette is disposed on its associated feeder docking station, collection docking station, or desktop station.
Referring now to FIG. 4, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 in the open position. Each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed around the peripheral edges on the inner side thereof a slot 70 which is a guide slot for the door 28. An end cap 72 is provided to cover the locking mechanism (not shown) and has two groups of three key access holes 74 and 76. The end cap 72 covers the end portion of the door 28 also. However, one of its primary functions is to hide the key mechanism to prevent unlocking of the system and also to protect the locking mechanism.
Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, there are illustrated side views of the left and right sides 24 and 26, respectively. Each of the left and right sides 24 and 26 have associated therewith a rack 78 with a surface extending upward. Each of these racks 78 is operable to interface with a toothed gear 80, as shown in FIG. 4. The left side 24 has disposed below the rack 78 a horizontal slot 84 that runs along the length of the rack 78, whereas the right side 26 has disposed below the rack 78 a plurality of vertical slots 86. The horizontal slot 84 is a guide slot for the compression panel 38, whereas the vertical slots 86 are locking slots, as will be described hereinbelow. In addition, each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed in the open end thereof a slot 90 and a slot 92, respectively, with each of the slots 90 and 92 having a detent 94 associated therewith. The detent 94 is operable to receive a pan head pin 96 on the right side of the door 30, the slot 90 operable to receive a similar pan head pin (not shown). The door 30, as will be described hereinbelow, is operable to reciprocate vertically in the closed position, such that the pin 96 can reciprocate downward into the detent 94. The left and right sides 24 and 26 are fabricated from a plastic material and the pan head pin 96 extends outward over the edge of the slot 90, it being a large diameter, such that it will prevent an individual from prying the sides 24 and 26 apart, gaining entrance thereto and then placing them back together. As will be described hereinbelow, when the door 28 is closed, it overlaps the door 30, preventing it from reciprocating upward and the pan head pin 96 rotating out of the slot 92.
Referring now to FIG. 7, there is illustrated an end view of the compression panel 38. The compression panel 38 is manufactured of a flat metal sheet having disposed on one side thereof a guide pin 100, proximate to the left side 24 and, on the other side thereof, a protrusion 102. The guide pin 100 is operable to be disposed within the guide slot 84 and the protrusion 102 is operable to fit within each of the slots 86 on the right side 26. The gears 80 are operable to be disposed within a slot 106 that has the rack 78 disposed therein and is proximate to the transparent window 32. Only the left side 24 is illustrated. The gears 80 are connected together through a shaft 108, the gears 80 fixedly attached to the shaft 108. In this manner, both gears 80 on either end of the shaft 108 are co-rotatable. The compression panel 38 is slidingly engaged with the shaft 108, such that it can slide in either direction and pivot about the shaft 108. A spring 110 is disposed between the edge of the compression panel 38 and the gear 80 proximate to the left side 24, such that the panel 38 is urged away from the guide slot 84.
In order to move the panel 38, the panel 38 is urged toward the slot 84, such that the guide pin 100 will be inserted in the slot 84. As this happens, the protrusion 102 is moved away from the right side 26 and the slots 86, thus allowing the panel 38 to be urged along the length of the cassette. When the panel 38 is at the appropriate position, the panel 38 is allowed to be moved away from the left side 24 and toward the right side 26 by the spring 110, such that the protrusion 102 will be inserted into one of the slots 86. Typically, this requires some manual manipulation.
The purpose for the fixed configuration of the shaft 108 and the two gears 80 is to prevent the panel 38 from skewing relative to a perpendicular orientation along the path of travel. Therefore, when the panel 38 is urged along the length of the cassette 20, both gears 80 must rotate and maintain a perpendicular orientation.
Referring now to FIG. 8, there is illustrated a detail of the open end showing the door 30 in an open position. The door 30 has associated with the left side a pan head pin 98 for interfacing with the slot 90. The door 30 is operable to rotate about hinges 112, which hinges 112 are asymmetrical, i.e., they are not round. This allows the door 30 to reciprocate in the planar surface thereof. This will allow the door 30 to reciprocate outward away from the pivoting area of the hinges 112, such that the narrow portion of the pan head pins 96 and 98 can insert in the slots 92 and 90, respectively, and then down into the detents 94. On the outermost edge of the door 30, there are provided two slots 114. The slots 114 are operable to interface with corresponding protrusions (not shown) on the docking station.
Referring now to FIG. 9, there is illustrated a side view of the door 30 in a closed position. The door 30 has a recess area 116 on the outer surface thereof which is operable to contain a handle 118. The handle 118 is operable to rotate about a pivot point 120 away from the recess area 116 and extend outward, as illustrated in FIG. 9. This allows the cassette 20 to be picked up. The pivot point 120 is disposed on a vertical protrusion 121 that extends outward from the door 30. A second protrusion 123 is also provided proximate to the end of the door 30 and having a lower height than the protrusion 121. The handle 118 has a pin 125 disposed thereon proximate to the pivot point 120 and slightly outward therefrom. The pin 125 is operable to fit within a recess 127 when the door 30 is closed. When the handle 118 is swung outward from the recess 116, the pin 125 contacts the upper surface of the recess 127 and forces the door 30 downward, such that the pin 98 is forced down into the detent 94. The two perpendicular protrusions 121 and 123 on the surface of the door 30 with the end of the door 28 (not shown) provide an overlap. The protrusions 121 and 123 prevent a would-be thief from slipping a note around the interface between the door 30 and the door 28.
Referring now to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a detail of the feeder docking station. At the feeder docking station, the cassette 20 is disposed in the cassette region 50 just below the buffer region 48. As noted above, the buffer region 48 is approximately equal to the length of the cassette region 50. The feeder mechanism 58 is comprised of a rod 130 that runs along the length of the feeder docking station. A reciprocating device 132 is disposed on the rod 130 and is attached to the paddle 56. The paddle 56 is operable to extend up over the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The reciprocating device 132 is interfaced with a chain 136, the chain constituting a part of the chain drive which is driven by a chain drive mechanism 138 on one end, the upper end, and a pulley mechanism 140 at the opposite end. The chain 136 moves in one direction. The reciprocating mechanism 132 has a release lever associated therewith (not shown) to allow it to be released. This is conventional in a sorter mechanism. Therefore, the reciprocating device 132 can be manually pulled down to a position beneath a group of notes 142.
As noted above, the cassette 20 is disposed in the feeder docking station after a previous cassette has been in the feeder docking station a sufficient amount of time for the paddle 56 to have been reciprocated upward and out of the cassette 20. When the new cassette 20 is disposed in the docking station, the end thereof is interfaced with a plurality of keys 146 that interface with the key slots 74 and 76. Once in the feeder docking station, the door 28 can be opened and door 30 then swiveled outward from the open end. At this point, the paddle 56 is at a location that is higher in the feeder docking station than the open end of the cassette 20. Since a typical cassette holds approximately 2,000 notes, there will be approximately 2,000 notes in the buffer region 48 when a cassette 20 is removed. At a feed rate of 1,500 notes per minute, it requires that a new cassette be disposed in the feeder docking station within less than approximately 1.5 minutes. Since the paddle 56 is reciprocating upward, the notes in the cassette 20 must be urged upward to contact the notes in the buffer region 50 and then the paddle 56 disposed behind the combined groups of notes. This can be done by two methods. In the first method, the user can push the notes in the buffer region upward to maintain a constant pressure thereon and then tilt the paddle 56 by rotating it after releasing it from the chain drive and then sliding it down the rod 130 to a point behind the notes in the cassette 20. The paddle 56 can then be utilized to slide the notes upward until they contact the notes in the buffer region 50, at which time the paddle 56 is then re-engaged with the chain drive. A second method is to urge the notes in the cassette upward from the cassette 20 to contact the back of the paddle 56, this being a manual operation. Thereafter, the user can hold these notes in place, rotate the paddle 56 upward and then place it behind the combined notes in the cassette and the ones previously in the buffer region 48. Thereafter, the operator waits for the notes to be urged completely out of the cassette 20 and then a new cassette placed in the feeder docking station. This is therefore a continuous and seamless operation to the sorter. In order to insure that the operation is continuous, the drive mechanism 138 provides a constant pressure on the notes. This is facilitated through the use of a pressure switch (not shown), which prevents too much pressure being placed on the notes with the paddle 56 or a direct drive motor. Either method is acceptable.
In order to facilitate removal of the cassette 20, a removal lever 150 is provided having an actuating arm 152. The actuating arm 152 is operable to be actuated and to cause the door 30 (not shown) to be urged upward, allowing the user to then complete door closing.
Referring now to FIG. 11, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 disposed in the collection docking station. The collection docking station is substantially similar to the feeder docking station, with the exception that it operates in the reverse end that it does not have as large a buffer region. The buffer region is approximately 6 inches, less than the length of a cassette 20. In this mechanism, the paddle 68 is reciprocated along a rod (not shown) similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. A reciprocating block 154 is provided which is operable to reciprocate along this rod (not shown). The reciprocating block 154 is interfaced with an engaging member that contacts the side of a toothed belt 156, the toothed belt 156 being disposed on an idler pulley 158, that is toothed, and to a toothed drive pulley 160 on the other end. Drive pulley 160 is driven by a belt drive motor 164. The blade 68 is operable to reciprocate upward a sufficient vertical distance to clear notes 168 that are disposed in the collection docking station. The paddle 68 can then be disengaged with the belt 56 and reciprocated to a desired position.
The operation is such that notes, after the sorting operation, are routed to the particular collection docking station in which the cassette 20 resides and are, via gravity, disposed therein. The surface of the collection docking station is at approximately a forty five degree angle. When the paddle is reciprocated up to the closest position to the sorting mechanism, the notes will be disposed in the sorter and, in response to notes coming into the particular collection docking station, the belt drive motor 164 will increment the belt 156 and reciprocate the paddle 68 down toward the lower end of the collection docking station, which is also the closed end of the cassette 20, when the cassette 20 is disposed in the collection docking station. As will be described hereinbelow, there are sensors that sense when the paddle 68 approaches the cassette 20 and, a switch associated with the cassette 20 being in place will be sensed. If this switch is set, indicating a cassette 20 is disposed therein, the operation will continue and the blade 68 will move downward. Once a sufficient number of notes to fill the capacity of the cassette 20 have been disposed at a particular collection station, the paddle 68 will then be moved downward in the cassette 20, the paddle 68 reciprocated vertically upward and then moved all the way to the top, such that new notes coming into the collection docking station can then be disposed on the upper surface of the paddle 68. The cassette 20 can then have the door thereof closed, and then removed from the collection docking station. A new empty cassette is then disposed therein. Typically, as described above, the cassette 20 is already open. However, the locking keys (not shown) are disposed on the collection docking station to allow the cassette 20 be in an unlocked position and thereafter allow the door 28 to be slidingly moved upward for closure.
Referring now to FIG. 12, there is illustrated a side view of the paddle 68 and the reciprocating member 154. The paddle 68 has a lower flat surface 170, which contacts the notes 168. An extending arm 172 extends upward over the right side 24 of the cassette 20 and downward to a vertically reciprocating arm 174. The vertically reciprocating arm 174 reciprocates within a slide bracket 176. Slide bracket 176 is attached to the reciprocating member 154, reciprocating member 154 having a cylindrical bore 178 disposed therethrough that is operable to reciprocate along the rod that was not shown in FIG. 11 and that is similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. Below the reciprocating member 178 is disposed a toothed block 180, toothed block 180 shown in a side view and operable to interface with the teeth on the inside surface of the belt 156 on the outer band. Whenever it is desired to release the toothed block 180 from the belt 156, it is only necessary to pull up on the arm 172 which will rotate the toothed block 180 away from the surface of the belt 156.
Referring now to FIG. 13, there is illustrated a top view of the collection docking station with the cassette 20 removed. The collection docking station has a flat plate 182 with sides 184 and 186 associated therewith, these providing a guide for the cassette 20 on either side thereof A door 184 is provided, which is substantially identical to the door 22 on the desktop docking station 16 in FIG. 2. This door 184 covers the key members 146 described above with respect to FIG. 10 and is operable to open in response to the cassette 20 being placed therein. The purpose of the door 184, as described above, is for protection and, also for a visual view to require the user to place the cassette above the door and then slide it down to open the door and insert the keys. Otherwise, the user might try to push down upon the keys 146, thus damaging the keys 146. A switch orifice 190 is provided for containing a switch 192, which switch 192 indicates the presence of the cassette 20 when the door 30 is opened. The door 30 is operable to open into a space 194 which has a plate 196 disposed on the upper end thereof. This plate 196 is raised and has two projections 198 and 200 which are operable to interface with the slots 114 and the door 30, as illustrated in FIG. 8. Therefore, the door 30 can be laid flat such that a flat surface is presented. The release lever device 150, described above with respect to FIG. 10, is disposed on the upper left side of the cassette 20 when disposed therein. An extending lever member 204 extends outward in front of the cassette 20 when installed and under the edge of the door 30, substantially under the pan head pin 98. Therefore, it is only necessary to actuate the lever 152 to raise the lever member 204 and pull the door 30 upward to allow the user to grasp this lever.
A sensor 206 is provided in the side of the buffer region 60 which is operable to sense the presence of notes on the surface of the paddle 68. The paddle 68 is reciprocated all the way up to the sorter such that it is past the sensor 206. The sensor will indicate that there are no notes past that point. Once the notes have been collected to a certain thickness, the paddle 68 will reciprocate past the sensor 206 and the sensor 206 will provide a signal to a central control system. The central control system will then determine if the switch 192 is depressed, indicating the presence of a cassette. If not, then the system will be shut down only when the paddle is not in the buffer region. If it is in the buffer region, it will continue to operate.
Referring now to FIG. 14, there is illustrated a top view of the closed end 72 of the cassette 20, illustrating the locking mechanism. A first shaft 210 extends between the left side 24 and right side 26 and has associated therewith on one side two pivoting lever members 212 and 214. On the opposite side, proximate to the right side 26, are disposed two similar pivoting lever members 216 and 218. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are separated by a plastic bushing 220 attached to the shaft 210 with springs 222 and 224 disposed between the block 220 and pivoting lever members 212 and 214, respectively. Similarly, a plastic block 226 is disposed between pivoting lever members 216 and 218 and separated therefrom by springs 228 and 230. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are disposed above the outside key access holes 74 on the left side of the end 72 and the two pivoting members 216 and 218 are each disposed against opposite ones of the outside holes on the key access hole 76. The key members 146 are comprised of two outside key members 231 and 232 and a central key member 236. The outside key members 231 and 232 of the key portion associated with the key access holes 74 are operable to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, on the key member 146 associated with the key access hole 76, the outer key members 231 and 232 are operable to pass through the outside key access holes 76 to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 216 and 218.
A second shaft 240 is provided that is disposed between the left side 24 and the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The shaft 240 is closer to the end 72. A pivoting lever 242 is disposed on the shaft 240 to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, a pivoting lever 244 is disposed on the shaft 240 and allowed to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever member 216 and 218. Disposed on each side of the pivoting members 242 are tracks (not shown}. These tracks are operable to receive pins 246 that extend outward from the associated pivoting members 212 and 214, or 216 and 218. This will be described in more in detail with respect to FIG. 15. The pivoting lever members 242 are urged upward with the center key members 236 in each of the key devices 146. As will be described hereinbelow, when the pivoting lever 242 is urged upward, it is necessary for the pivoting action of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214, and 216 and 216 to traverse the path such that the pins 246 disposed in the ends and extending outward therefrom will traverse a particular path. Therefore, there is a defined shape to each of the members 231 and 232 which will determine this path.
Referring now to FIG. 15, there is illustrated a side view of a locking member looking into the side of the right side 26. There is provided a locking lever 250, which is pivoted on one end at a pivot point 252 and has a "crook" 254 on the other end thereof, this crook being at a distance from the pivot point 252, such that the crook 252 will pivot into the path 70. Whenever the door 28 slides through the guide 70 into the crook 254, the locking lever 250 rotated such that the crook 254 is in that path, this will prevent further movement. Additionally, once the door 28 is urged against the crook 254, the direction of forces is "normal" to the pivot point 252, such that the lever 250 is not stressed, the force being along the length thereof.
The lever member 244 extends outward from the shaft 240 and has a pivoting shaft 256 disposed thereon, which is pivoted about a hole in the distal end of the locking lever 250, distal from the pivoting point 252. Whenever the lever 244 is urged upward by the locking pin 234, the pivoting shaft 256 will be urged upward, pivoting the locking lever 250 about the pivot point 252 and moving the crook 254 away from the path 70, to thereby allow the door 28 to pass thereby.
The pivoting lever 244 has a track 260 formed in the side thereof that is operable to interface with the pin 246 in the lever 216. An opposite path is disposed on the opposite side to interface with the pin 246 in the pivoting lever 218. This path 260 is configured such that, as lever 244 pivots upward, the end of the pivoting lever 216 must pivot in such a manner that the pin 246 will meander along the correct path. If the shape of the key member 231 is not correct, the path will be wrong and it will fall into defined "pockets" which will prevent further movement and further pivoting of lever 244. The shape of both key members 231 and 232 must be correct in order to insure that the end of the pivoting members 216 and 218 traverse the defined path.
In summary, there has been provided a currency sorting system utilizing a cassette for transporting the currency between locations. The cassette is a secured device that has an interior with a door that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the currency and an end that allows currency to be reciprocated out in a push operation. The cassette has a locking device for engaging with a corresponding key on a docking station, such that when the cassette is disposed on the docking station, the door will open. When removed from the docking station, and the door is closed, the door cannot be opened. The cassette is hand loaded at one docking station and then secured for movement to a second docking station that is associated with a sorting mechanism. On the sorting mechanism, it is necessary to feed the notes into the sorter input. The feeding docking station is approximately twice the length of the cassette with a cassette region and a buffer region. A paddle is utilized to extend downward into the cassette to urge the notes up into the buffer region. Once the notes are in the buffer region, the cassette can be removed and another cassette disposed therein and the paddle again moved into the cassette to urge the notes outward in a continuous motion. When the cassette is removed, it is then disposed in a third collection docking station in a collection slot. The collection slot is associated with a sorter output wherein notes that are sorted are disposed in particular ones of the collection docking stations. A paddle is provided in this station that reciprocates downward into the cassette as notes are disposed in that particular docking station. When the cassette is full, it can then be removed.
Although the preferred embodiment has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

This “Cahier Technique” reviews the calculation methods for short-circuit currents as laid down by standards such as IEC 60909. It is intended for radial and meshed low-voltage (LV) and high-voltage (HV) circuits. The aim is to provide a further understanding of the calculation methods, essential when determining short-circuit currents, even when computerised methods are employed. the impedance method Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.4 1 Introduction Electrical installations almost always require protection against short-circuits wherever there is an electrical discontinuity. This most often corresponds to points where there is a change in conductor cross-section. The short-circuit current must be calculated at each level in the installation in view of determining the characteristics of the equipment required to withstand or break the fault current. The flow chart in Figure 1 indicates the procedure for determining the various shortcircuit currents and the resulting parameters for the different protection devices of a low-voltage installation. In order to correctly select and adjust the protection devices, the graphs in Figures 2, 3 and 4 are used. Two values of the short-circuit current must be evaluated: c The maximum short-circuit current, used to determine v The breaking capacity of the circuit breakers v The making capacity of the circuit breakers v The electrodynamic withstand capacity of the wiring system and switchgear The maximum short-circuit current corresponds to a short-circuit in the immediate vicinity of the downstream terminals of the protection device. It must be calculated accurately and used with a safety margin. c The minimum short-circuit current, essential when selecting the time-current curve for circuit breakers and fuses, in particular when Upstream Ssc u (%) Isc at transformer terminals Isc of main LV switchboard outgoers Isc at head of secondary switchboards Isc at head of final switchboards Isc at end of final outgoers Conductor characteristics b Busbars v Length v Width v Thickness b Cables v Type of insulation v Single-core or multicore v Length v Cross-section b Environment v Ambient temperature v Installation method v Number of contiguous circuits Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity Inst. trip setting Main circuit breaker Main LV switchboard distribution circuit breakers Secondary distribution circuit breakers Final distribution circuit breakers b Feeder current ratings b Voltage drops HV / LV transformer rating Load rating sc b Power factor b Coincidence factor b Duty factor b Foreseeable expansion factor Fig. 1 : Short-circuit (Isc) calculation procedure when designing a low-voltage electrical installation (ST = short time; Inst. = instantaneous) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.5 v Cables are long and/or the source impedance is relatively high (generators, UPSs) v Protection of life depends on circuit breaker or fuse operation, essentially the case for TN and IT electrical systems Note that the minimum short-circuit current corresponds to a short-circuit at the end of the protected line, generally phase-to-earth for LV and phase-to-phase for HV (neutral not distributed), under the least severe operating conditions (fault at the end of a feeder and not just downstream from a protection device, one transformer in service when two can be connected, etc.). Note also that whatever the case, for whatever type of short-circuit current (minimum or maximum), the protection device must clear the short-circuit within a time tc that is compatible with the thermal stresses that can be withstood by the protected cable: i 2 ∫ dt k A2 2 i (see Fig. 2, 3, and 4) where A is the cross-sectional area of the conductors and k is a constant calculated on the basis of different correction factors for the cable installation method, contiguous circuits, etc. Further practical information may be found in the “Electrical Installation Guide” published by Schneider Electric (see the bibliography). 1.1 The main types of short-circuits Various types of short-circuits can occur in electrical installations. Characteristics of short-circuits The primary characteristics are: c Duration (self-extinguishing, transient and steady-state) c Origin v Mechanical (break in a conductor, accidental electrical contact between two conductors via a foreign conducting body such as a tool or an animal) v Internal or atmospheric overvoltages a5 s Iz1 < Iz2 t 1 2 I2t = k2S2 I Fig. 2 : The I2t characteristics of a conductor depending on the ambient temperature (1 and 2 represent the rms value of the current in the conductor at different temperatures θ1 and θ2, with θ1 > θ2; Iz being the limit of the permissible current under steady-state conditions).

This type of fault often degenerates into a three phase fault c Three-phase (only 5% of initial faults) These different short-circuit currents are presented in Figure 5 . Consequences of short-circuits The consequences are variable depending on the type and the duration of the fault, the point in the installation where the fault occurs and the short-circuit power. Consequences include: c At the fault location, the presence of electrical arcs, resulting in v Damage to insulation v Welding of conductors v Fire and danger to life c On the faulty circuit v Electrodynamic forces, resulting in - Deformation of the busbars - Disconnection of cables v Excessive temperature rise due to an increase in Joule losses, with the risk of damage to insulation c On other circuits in the network or in near-by networks v Voltage dips during the time required to clear the fault, ranging from a few milliseconds to a few hundred milliseconds v Shutdown of a part of the network, the extent of that part depending on the design of the network and the discrimination levels offered by the protection devices v Dynamic instability and/or the loss of machine synchronisation v Disturbances in control / monitoring circuits v etc. Fig. 5 : Different types of short-circuits and their currents.

Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.7 1.2 Development of the short-circuit current A simplified network comprises a source of constant AC power, a switch, an impedance Zsc that represents all the impedances upstream of the switch, and a load impedance Zs (see Fig. 6 ). In a real network, the source impedance is made up of everything upstream of the short-circuit including the various networks with different voltages (HV, LV) and the series-connected wiring systems with different cross-sectional areas (A) and lengths. In Figure 6, when the switch is closed and no fault is present, the design current Is flows through the network. When a fault occurs between A and B, the negligible impedance between these points results in a very high short-circuit current Isc that is limited only be impedance Zsc. The current Isc develops under transient conditions depending on the reactances X and the resistances R that make up impedance Zsc: Zsc = R X 2 2 + In power distribution networks, reactance X = L ϕ is normally much greater than resistance R and the R / X ratio is between 0.1 and 0.3. The ratio is virtually equals cos ϕ for low values: cos R R X 2 2 ϕ = + However, the transient conditions prevailing while the short-circuit current develops differ depending on the distance between the fault location and the generator. This distance is not necessarily physical, but means that the generator impedances are less than the impedance of the elements between the generator and the fault location. Fault far from the generator This is the most frequent situation. The transient conditions are those resulting from the application of a voltage to a reactor-resistance circuit. This voltage is: e = E 2 sin t + (ω α) Current i is then the sum of the two components: i = i i ac dc + c The first (iac) is alternating and sinusoidal i = sin t + ac Ι 2 (ω αϕ− ) where I = E Zsc , α = angle characterising the difference between the initiation of the fault and zero voltage. c The second (idc) is an aperiodic component i dc - R L t = − - 2 si Ι αϕ n e ( ) . Its initial value depends on a and its decay rate is proportional to R / L. At the initiation of the short-circuit, i is equal to zero by definition (the design current Is is negligible), hence: i = iac + idc = 0 Figure 7 shows the graphical composition of i as the algebraic sum of its two components iac and idc Fig. 6 : Simplified network diagram.

The voltage can therefore be expressed as: u = E 2 . sin ( t + ) ω α . The current therefore develops as follows: i = E 2 Z sin t + - - - e sin - R L t (ω αϕ αϕ ) ( )         with its two components, one being alternating with a shift equal to ϕ with respect to the voltage and the second aperiodic and decaying to zero as t tends to infinity. Hence the two extreme cases defined by: c α = ϕ ≈ π / 2, said to be symmetrical (or balanced) (see Fig. a ) The fault current can be defined by: i = E 2 Z sin t ω which, from the initiation, has the same shape as for steady state conditions with a peak value E / Z. c α = 0, said to be asymmetrical (or unbalanced) (see Fig. b ) The fault current can be defined by: i = E 2 Z sin t - + sin e- R L t ( ) ωϕ ϕ         Its initial peak value ip therefore depends on ϕ on the R / X ≈ cos ϕ ratio of the circuit.

The factor e R L − t is inversely proportional to the aperiodic component damping, determined by the R / L or R / X ratios. The value of ip must therefore be calculated to determine the making capacity of the required circuit breakers and to define the electrodynamic forces that the installation as a whole must be capable of withstanding. Its value may be deduced from the rms value of the symmetrical short-circuit current Ιa using the equation: ip = κ . r . Ia, where the coefficient κ is indicated by the curve in Figure 9 , as a function of the ratio R / X or R / L, corresponding to the expression: κ = + − 1 02 0 98 3 . . e R X Fault near the generator When the fault occurs in the immediate vicinity of the generator supplying the circuit, the variation in the impedance of the generator, in this case the dominant impedance, damps the short-circuit current. The transient current-development conditions are in this case modified by the variation in the electromotive force resulting from the shortcircuit. For simplicity, the electromotive force is assumed to be constant and the internal reactance of the machine variable. The reactance develops in three stages: c Subtransient (the first 10 to 20 milliseconds of the fault) c Transient (up to 500 milliseconds) c Steady-state (or synchronous reactance) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.9 Note that in the indicated order, the reactance acquires a higher value at each stage, i.e. the subtransient reactance is less than the transient reactance, itself less than the synchronous reactance. The successive effect of the three reactances leads to a gradual reduction in the short-circuit current which is the sum of four components (see Fig. 10 ): c The three alternating components (subtransient, transient and steady-state) c The aperiodic component resulting from the development of the current in the circuit (inductive) This short-circuit current i(t) is maximum for a closing angle corresponding to the zero-crossing of the voltage at the instant the fault occurs. Fig. 10 : Total short-circuit current isc (e), and contribution of its components: a) subtransient reactance = X”d b) transient reactance = X’d c) synchronous reactance = Xd d) aperiodic component. Note that the decrease in the generator reactance is faster than that of the aperiodic component. This is a rare situation that can cause saturation of the magnetic circuits and interruption problems because several periods occur before the current passes through zero. 0 t (s) 0 t (s) 0 t (s) 0 t (s) 0 t (s) a) b) c) d) e) 0.3 Subtransient Transient Steady-state 0.1 0.5 Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.10 It is therefore given by the following expression: it E X X e X X e X t E X e d d t T d d t T d d dd a t T ( ) '' ' / ' / '' / '' ' = −       + −       +         − − − − 2 11 11 1 2 cos ω Where: E: Phase-to-neutral rms voltage across the generator terminals X"d: Subtransient reactance X'd: Transient reactance Xd: Synchronous (steady-state) reactance T"d: Subtransient time constant T'd: Transient time constant Ta: Aperiodic time constant Practically speaking, information on the development of the short-circuit current is not essential: c In a LV installation, due to the speed of the breaking devices, the value of the subtransient short-circuit current, denoted I" k , and of the maximum asymmetrical peak amplitude ip is sufficient when determining the breaking capacities of the protection devices and the electrodynamic forces c In LV power distribution and in HV applications, however, the transient short-circuit current is often used if breaking occurs before the steady-state stage, in which case it becomes useful to use the short-circuit breaking current, denoted Ib, which determines the breaking capacity of the timedelayed circuit breakers. Ib is the value of the short-circuit current at the moment interruption is effective, i.e. following a time t after the beginning of the short-circuit, where t = tmin. Time tmin (minimum time delay) is the sum of the minimum operating time of a protection relay and the shortest opening time of the associated circuit breaker, i.e. the shortest time between the appearance of the short-circuit current and the initial separation of the pole contacts on the switching device. Figure 11 presents the various currents of the short-circuits defined above. 1.3 Standardised Isc calculations The standards propose a number of methods. c Application guide C 15-105, which supplements NF C 15-100 (Normes Françaises) (low-voltage AC installations), details three methods v The “impedance” method, used to calculate fault currents at any point in an installation with a high degree of accuracy. This method involves adding the various resistances and reactances of the fault loop separately, from (and including) the source to the given point, and then calculating the corresponding impedance. The Isc value is finally obtained by applying Ohm’s law: Isc = Un 3∑(Z) . All the characteristics of the various elements in the fault loop must be known (sources and wiring systems). v The “composition” method, which may be used when the characteristics of the power supply are not known. The upstream impedance of the given circuit is calculated on the basis of an Fig. 11 : short-circuit currents near a generator (schematic diagram). i Asymmetrical Symmetrical Subtrans. Transient Steady-state 2r I" k ip 2r Ik Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.11 estimate of the short-circuit current at its origin. Power factor cos ϕ ≈ R / X is assumed to be identical at the origin of the circuit and the fault location. In other words, it is assumed that the elementary impedances of two successive sections in the installation are sufficiently similar in their characteristics to justify the replacement of vectorial addition of the impedances by algebraic addition. This approximation may be used to calculate the value of the short-circuit current modulus with sufficient accuracy for the addition of a circuit. v The “conventional” method, which can be used when the impedances or the Isc in the installation upstream of the given circuit are not known, to calculate the minimum short-circuit currents and the fault currents at the end of a line. It is based on the assumption that the voltage at the circuit origin is equal to 80% of the rated voltage of the installation during the shortcircuit or the fault. Conductor reactance is neglected for sizes under 150 mm2. It is taken into account for large sizes by increasing the resistance 15% for 150 mm2, 20% for 185 mm2, 25% for 240 mm2 and 30% for 300 mm2. This method is used essentially for final circuits with origins sufficiently far from the source. It is not applicable in installations supplied by a generator. c Standard IEC 60909 (VDE 0102) applies to all networks, radial or meshed, up to 550 kV. This method, based on the Thevenin theorem, calculates an equivalent voltage source at the short-circuit location and then determines the corresponding short-circuit current. All network feeders as well as the synchronous and asynchronous machines are replaced in the calculation by their impedances (positive sequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence). All line capacitances and the parallel admittances of non-rotating loads, except those of the zero-sequence system, are neglected. 1.4 Methods presented in this document In this “Cahier Technique” publication, two methods are presented for the calculation of short-circuit currents in radial networks: c The impedance method, reserved primarily for LV networks, was selected for its high degree of accuracy and its instructive value, given that virtually all characteristics of the circuit are taken into account c The IEC 60909 method, used primarily for HV networks, was selected for its accuracy and its analytical character. More technical in nature, it implements the symmetrical-component principle 1.5 Basic assumptions To simplify the short-circuit calculations, a number of assumptions are required. These impose limits for which the calculations are valid but usually provide good approximations, facilitating comprehension of the physical phenomena and consequently the short-circuit current calculations. They nevertheless maintain a fully acceptable level of accuracy, “erring” systematically on the conservative side. The assumptions used in this document are as follows: c The given network is radial with nominal voltages ranging from LV to HV, but not exceeding 550 kV, the limit set by standard IEC 60909 c The short-circuit current, during a three-phase short-circuit, is assumed to occur simultaneously on all three phases c During the short-circuit, the number of phases involved does not change, i.e. a three-phase fault remains three-phase and a phase-to-earth fault remains phase-to-earth c For the entire duration of the short-circuit, the voltages responsible for the flow of the current and the short-circuit impedance do not change significantly c Transformer regulators or tap-changers are assumed to be set to a main position (if the short-circuit occurs away far from the generator, the actual position of the transformer regulator or tap-changers does not need to be taken into account c Arc resistances are not taken into account c All line capacitances are neglected c Load currents are neglected c All zero-sequence impedances are taken into account Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.12 2 Calculation of Isc by the impedance method 2.1 Isc depending on the different types of short-circuit Three-phase short-circuit This fault involves all three phases. Short-circuit current Isc3 is equal to: Ιsc U / 3 Zcc 3 = where U (phase-to-phase voltage) corresponds to the transformer no-load voltage which is 3 to 5% greater than the on-load voltage across the terminals. For example, in 390 V networks, the phase-to-phase voltage adopted is U = 410 V, and the phase-to-neutral voltage is U / 3 = 237 V. Calculation of the short-circuit current therefore requires only calculation of Zsc, the impedance equal to all the impedances through which Isc flows from the generator to the location of the fault, i.e. the impedances of the power sources and the lines (see Fig. 12 ). This is, in fact, the “positive-sequence” impedance per phase: Zsc = R X  ∑ ∑   +     2 2 where ∑R = the sum of series resistances, ∑X = the sum of series reactances. It is generally considered that three-phase faults provoke the highest fault currents. The fault current in an equivalent diagram of a polyphase system is limited by only the impedance of one phase at the phase-to-neutral voltage of thenetwork. Calculation of Isc3 is therefore essential for selection of equipment (maximum current and electrodynamic withstand capability). Fig. 12 : The various short-circuit currents. ZL Zsc V ZL ZL ZL ZL U Zsc Zsc ZL ZLn V ZLn Zsc ZL Zo V Zo Zsc Three-phase fault Phase-to-phase fault Phase-to-neutral fault Phase-to-earth fault Ιsc U / 3 Zsc 3 = Ιsc U / 3 Zsc + Z 1 Ln = Ιsc U 2 . Zsc 2 = Ιsc U / 3 Zsc + Z o o = Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.13 Phase-to-phase short-circuit clear of earth This is a fault between two phases, supplied with a phase-to-phase voltage U. In this case, the short-circuit current Isc2 is less than that of a three-phase fault: Ι ΙΙ sc U 2 Zsc = 3 2 sc 0.86 sc 2 3 3 = ≈ For a fault occuring near rotating machines, the impedance of the machines is such that Isc2 is close to Isc3. Phase-to-neutral short-circuit clear of earth This is a fault between one phase and the neutral, supplied with a phase-to-neutral voltage V = U / 3 The short-circuit current Isc1 is: Ιsc = U / 3 Zsc + Z 1 Ln In certain special cases of phase-to-neutral faults, the zero-sequence impedance of the source is less than Zsc (for example, at the terminals of a star-zigzag connected transformer or of a generator under subtransient conditions). In this case, the phase-to-neutral fault current may be greater than that of a three-phase fault. Phase-to-earth fault (one or two phases) This type of fault brings the zero-sequence impedance Zo into play. Except when rotating machines are involved (reduced zero-sequence impedance), the shortcircuit current Isco is less than that of a three phase fault. Calculation of Isco may be necessary, depending on the neutral system (system earthing arrangement), in view of defining the setting thresholds for the zero-sequence (HV) or earthfault (LV) protection devices. Figure 12 shows the various short-circuit currents. 2.2 Determining the various short-circuit impedances This method involves determining the shortcircuit currents on the basis of the impedance represented by the “circuit” through which the short-circuit current flows. This impedance may be calculated after separately summing the various resistances and reactances in the fault loop, from (and including) the power source to the fault location. (The circled numbers X may be used to come back to important information while reading the example at the end of this section.) Network impedances c Upstream network impedance Generally speaking, points upstream of the power source are not taken into account. Available data on the upstream network is therefore limited to that supplied by the power distributor, i.e. only the short-circuit power Ssc in MVA. The equivalent impedance of the upstream network is: 1 Zup = U Ssc 2 where U is the no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the network. The upstream resistance and reactance may be deduced from Rup / Zup (for HV) by: Rup / Zup ≈ 0.3 at 6 kV; Rup / Zup ≈ 0.2 at 20 kV; Rup / Zup ≈ 0.1 at 150 kV. As, Xup Za - Ra = 2 2 , Xup Zup = 1 - Rup Z pu       2 2 Therefore, for 20 kV, Xup Zup . = 1 - 0.2 ( ) = 2 0 980 Xup 0.980 Zup at 20kV, = hence the approximation Xup Zup ≈ . c Internal transformer impedance The impedance may be calculated on the basis of the short-circuit voltage usc expressed as a percentage: 3 Z u 100 U Sn T sc 2 = , U = no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the transformer; Sn = transformer kVA rating; u 100 sc = voltage that must be applied to the primary winding of the transformer for the rated current to flow through the secondary winding, when the LV secondary terminals are shortcircuited. For public distribution MV / LV transformers, the values of usc have been set by the European Harmonisation document HD 428-1S1 issued in October 1992 (see Fig. 13 ) .

For low power levels, however, calculation of ZT is required because the ratio RT / XT is higher. The resistance is calculated using the joule losses (W) in the windings: W = 3 R R W 3 n T T 2 Ι Ι n2 ⇒ = Notes: 5 v When n identically-rated transformers are connected in parallel, their internal impedance values, as well as the resistance and reactance values, must be divided by n v Particular attention must be paid to special transformers, for example, the transformers for rectifier units have Usc values of up to 10 to 12% in order to limit short-circuit currents. When the impedance upstream of the transformer and the transformer internal impedance are taken into account, the shortcircuit current may be expressed as: Ιsc = U 3 Zup ZT ( + ) Initially, Zup and ZT may be considered comparable to their respective reactances. The short-circuit impedance Zsc is therefore equal to the algebraic sum of the two. The upstream network impedance may be neglected, in which case the new current value is: Ι'sc = U 3 ZT The relative error is: ∆Ι Ι Ι Ι Ι sc sc sc - sc sc Z p Z U Ssc T u U 2 sc 2 ' = == u 100 Sn i.e. : ∆Ι Ι sc sc u Sn Ssc sc = 100 Figure 14 indicates the level of conservative error in the calculation of Isc, due to the fact that the upstream impedance is neglected. The figure demonstrates clearly that it is possible to neglect the upstream impedance for networks where the short-circuit power Ssc is much higher than the transformer kVA rating Sn. For example, when Ssc / Sn = 300, the error is approximately 5%. c Line impedance The line impedance ZL depends on the resistance per unit length, the reactance per unit length and the length of the line. v The resistance per unit length of overhead lines, cables and busbars is calculated as R A L = ρ where S = cross-sectional area of the conductor; ρ = conductor resistivity, however the value used varies, depending on the calculated short-circuit current (minimum or maximum). 6 The table in Figure 15 provides values for each of the above-mentioned cases. Practically speaking, for LV and conductors with cross-sectional areas less than 150 mm2, only the resistance is taken into account (RL < 0.15 mΩ / m when A > 150 mm2). v The reactance per unit length of overhead lines, cables and busbars may be calculated as X L 15.7 144.44 Log d r L == +            ω  Fig. 14 : Resultant error in the calculation of the short-circuit current when the upstream network impedance Zup is neglected. 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 0 5 10 12 Sn (kVA) Ssc = 250 MVA Ssc = 500 MVA ∆Isc/Isc (%) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.15 expressed as mΩ / km for a single-phase or three-phase delta cable system, where (in mm): r = radius of the conducting cores; d = average distance between conductors. NB : Above, Log = decimal logarithm. For overhead lines, the reactance increases slightly in proportion to the distance between conductors (Log d t       ), and therefore in proportion to the operating voltage. 7 the following average values are to be used: X = 0.3 Ω / km (LV lines); X = 0.4 Ω / km (MV or HV lines). Figure 16 shows the various reactance values for conductors in LV applications, depending on the wiring system (practical values drawn from French standards, also used in other European countries). The following average values are to be used: - 0.08 mΩ / m for a three-phase cable ( ), and, for HV applications, between 0.1 and 0.15 mΩ / m. 8 - 0.09 mΩ / m for touching, single-conductor cables (flat or triangular ); 9 - 0.15 mΩ / m as a typical value for busbars ( ) and spaced, single-conductor cables ( ) ; For “sandwiched-phase” busbars (e.g. Canalis - Telemecanique), the reactance is considerably lower. Notes : v The impedance of the short lines between the distribution point and the HV / LV transformer may be neglected. This assumption gives a conservative error concerning the short-circuit current. The error increases in proportion to the transformer rating v The cable capacitance with respect to the earth (common mode), which is 10 to 20 times greater than that between the lines, must be taken into account for earth faults. Generally speaking, the capacitance of a HV three-phase cable with a cross-sectional area of 120 mm2 is in the order Fig. 16 : Cables reactance values depending on the wiring system.

If one of the values, RL or XL, is low with respect to the other, it may be neglected because the resulting error for impedance ZL is consequently very low. For example, if the ratio between RL and XL is 3, the error in ZL is 5.1%. The curves for RL and XL (see Fig. 17 ) may be used to deduce the cable cross-sectional areas for which the impedance may be considered comparable to the resistance or to the reactance. Examples : v First case: Consider a three-phase cable, at 20°C, with copper conductors. Their reactance is 0.08 mΩ / m. The RL and XL curves (see Fig. 17) indicate that impedance ZL approaches two asymptotes, RL for low cable cross-sectional areas and XL = 0.08 mΩ / m for high cable cross-sectional areas. For the low and high cable cross-sectional areas, the impedance ZL curve may be considered identical to the asymptotes. The given cable impedance is therefore considered, with a margin of error less than 5.1%, comparable to: - A resistance for cable cross-sectional areas less than 74 mm2 - A reactance for cable cross-sectional areas greater than 660 mm2 v Second case: Consider a three-phase cable, at 20 °C, with aluminium conductors. As above, the impedance ZL curve may be considered identical to the asymptotes, but for cable crosssectional areas less than 120 mm2 and greater than 1,000 mm2 (curves not shown) Impedance of rotating machines. c Synchronous generators The impedances of machines are generally expressed as a percentage, for example: x n 100 sc = I I (where x is the equivalent of the transformer usc). Consider: 10 Z = x 100 U Sn 2 where U = no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the generator, Sn = generator VA rating. 11 What is more, given that the value of R / X is low, in the order of 0.05 to 0.1 for MV and 0.1 to 0.2 for LV, impedance Z may be considered comparable to reactance X. Values for x are given in the table in Figure 18 for turbogenerators with smooth rotors and for “hydraulic” generators with salient poles (low speeds). In the table, it may seem surprising to see that the synchronous reactance for a shortcircuit exceeds 100% (at that point in time, Isc < In) . However, the short-circuit current is essentially inductive and calls on all the reactive power that the field system, even over-excited, can supply, whereas the rated current essentially carries the active power supplied by the turbine (cos ϕ from 0.8 to 1). c Synchronous compensators and motors The reaction of these machines during a shortcircuit is similar to that of generators. 12 They produce a current in the network that depends on their reactance in % (see Fig. 19 ). c Asynchronous motors When an asynchronous motor is cut from the network, it maintains a voltage across its terminals that disappears within a few hundredths of a second. When a short-circuit occurs across the terminals, the motor supplies a current that disappears even more rapidly, according to time constants in the order of: Fig. 18 : Generator reactance values. in per unit.

Consequently, the large number of LV motors, with low individual outputs, present on industrial sites may be a source of difficulties in that it is not easy to foresee the average number of motors running that will contribute to the fault when a short-circuit occurs. Individual calculation of the reverse current for each motor, taking into account the line impedance, is therefore a tedious and futile task. Common practice, notably in the United States, is to take into account the combined contribution to the fault current of all the asynchronous LV motors in an installation. 13 They are therefore thought of as a unique source, capable of supplying to the busbars a current equal to Istart/Ir times the sum of the rated currents of all installed motors. Other impedances. c Capacitors A shunt capacitor bank located near the fault location will discharge, thus increasing the shortcircuit current. This damped oscillatory discharge is characterised by a high initial peak value that is superposed on the initial peak of the shortcircuit current, even though its frequency is far greater than that of the network. Depending on the timing between the initiation of the fault and the voltage wave, two extreme cases must be considered: v If the initiation of the fault coincides with zero voltage, the short-circuit discharge current is asymmetrical, with a maximum initial amplitude peak v Conversely, if the initiation of the fault coincides with maximum voltage, the discharge current superposes itself on the initial peak of the fault current, which, because it is symmetrical, has a low value It is therefore unlikely, except for very powerful capacitor banks, that superposition will result in an initial peak higher than the peak current of an asymmetrical fault. It follows that when calculating the maximum short-circuit current, capacitor banks do not need to be taken into account. However, they must nonetheless be considered when selecting the type of circuit breaker. During opening, capacitor banks significantly reduce the circuit frequency and thus affect current interruption. c Switchgear 14 Certain devices (circuit breakers, contactors with blow-out coils, direct thermal relays, etc.) have an impedance that must be taken into account, for the calculation of Isc, when such a device is located upstream of the device intended to break the given short-circuit and remain closed (selective circuit breakers). 15 For LV circuit breakers, for example, a reactance value of 0.15 mΩ is typical, while the resistance is negligible. For breaking devices, a distinction must be made depending on the speed of opening: v Certain devices open very quickly and thus significantly reduce short-circuit currents. This is the case for fast-acting, limiting circuit breakers and the resultant level of electrodynamic forces and thermal stresses, for the part of the installation concerned, remains far below the theoretical maximum v Other devices, such as time-delayed circuit breakers, do not offer this advantage c Fault arc The short-circuit current often flows through an arc at the fault location. The resistance of the arc is considerable and highly variable. The voltage drop over a fault arc can range from 100 to 300 V. For HV applications, this drop is negligible with respect to the network voltage and the arc has no effect on reducing the short-circuit current. For LV applications, however, the actual fault current when an arc occurs is limited to a much lower level than that calculated (bolted, solid fault), because the voltage is much lower. 16 For example, the arc resulting from a shortcircuit between conductors or busbars may reduce the prospective short-circuit current by 20 to 50% and sometimes by even more than 50% for nominal voltages under 440 V. However, this phenomenon, highly favourable in the LV field and which occurs for 90% of faults, may not be taken into account when determining the breaking capacity because 10% of faults take place during closing of a device, producing a solid Fig. 19 : Synchronous compensator and motor reactance values, in per unit.

This phenomenon should, however, be taken into account for the calculation of the minimum short-circuit current. c Various impedances Other elements may add non-negligible impedances. This is the case for harmonics filters and inductors used to limit the short-circuit current. They must, of course, be included in calculations, as well as wound-primary type current transformers for which the impedance values vary depending on the rating and the type of construction. expressed in %. Z 1 Sn MR = x 100 c For the system as a whole, after having calculated all the relative impedances, the shortcircuit power may be expressed as: Ssc ZR = 1 Σ from which it is possible to deduce the fault current Isc at a point with a voltage U: Ι Σ sc = Ssc 3 U 1 3 U ZR = ΣZR is the composed vector sum of all the impedances related to elements upstream of the fault. It is therefore the relative impedance of the upstream network as seen from a point at U voltage. Hence, Ssc is the short-circuit power, in VA, at a point where voltage is U. For example, if we consider the simplified diagram of Figure 20 : At point A, Ssc = U Z U U Z LV T LV HV L 2 2       + Hence, Ssc = 1 Z U Z U T HV 2 L LV 2 + Fig. 20 : Calculating Ssc at point A. UHT ZT UBT ZC A 2.3 Relationships between impedances at the different voltage levels in an installation Impedances as a function of the voltage The short-circuit power Ssc at a given point in the network is defined by: Ssc = U 3 U Zsc 2 Ι = This means of expressing the short-circuit power implies that Ssc is invariable at a given point in the network, whatever the voltage. And the equation Ιsc U 3 Zsc 3 = implies that all impedances must be calculated with respect to the voltage at the fault location, which leads to certain complications that often produce errors in calculations for networks with two or more voltage levels. For example, the impedance of a HV line must be multiplied by the square of the reciprocal of the transformation ratio, when calculating a fault on the LV side of the transformer: 17 Z Z U U BT HT BT HT =       2 A simple means of avoiding these difficulties is the relative impedance method proposed by H. Rich. Calculation of the relative impedances This is a calculation method used to establish a relationship between the impedances at the different voltage levels in an electrical installation. This method proposes dividing the impedances (in ohms) by the square of the network line-toline voltage (in volts) at the point where the impedances exist. The impedances therefore become relative (ZR). c For overhead lines and cables, the relative resistances and reactances are defined as: R R U and X X U CR 2 CR 2 = = with R and X in ohms and U in volts. c For transformers, the impedance is expressed on the basis of their short-circuit voltages usc and their kVA rating Sn: Z 1 Sn TR s = u c 100 c For rotating machines, the equation is identical, with x representing the impedanc Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.19 2.4 Calculation example (with the impedances of the power sources, the upstream network and the power supply transformers as well as those of the electrical lines) Problem Consider a 20 kV network that supplies a HV / LV substation via a 2 km overhead line, and a 1 MVA generator that supplies in parallel the busbars of the same substation. Two 1,000 kVA parallel-connected transformers supply the LV busbars which in turn supply 20 outgoers to 20 motors, including the one supplying motor M. All motors are rated 50 kW, all connection cables are identical and all motors are running when the fault occurs. The Isc3 and ip values must be calculated at the various fault locations indicated in the network diagram (see Fig. 21 ), that is: c Point A on the HV busbars, with a negligible impedance c Point B on the LV busbars, at a distance of 10 meters from the transformers c Point C on the busbars of an LV subdistribution board c Point D at the terminals of motor M Then the reverse current of the motors must be calculated at C and B, then at D and A.

V - Reverse currents of the motors It is often faster to simply consider the motors as independent generators, injecting into the fault a “reverse current” that is superimposed on the network fault current. c Fault at C The current produced by the motor may be calculated on the basis of the “motor + cable” impedance: XM 605 2.7 10 608 m 3 = + ( ) ≈ − Ω R 10 M m -3 = + (121 19 3 140 . ) ≈ Ω ZM = 624 mΩ hence ΙM x x = ≈ − 410 3 624 10 379 3 A For the 20 motors ΙMC = 7,580 A. Instead of making the above calculations, it is possible (see 13 ) to estimate the current injected by all the motors as being equal to (Istart / Ir) times their rated current (98 A), i.e. (4.8 x 98) x 20 = 9,400 A.

Again, it is possible to estimate the current injected by all the motors as being equal to 4.8 times their rated current (98 A), i.e. 9,400 A. The approximation again overestimates the real value of IMB. Using the fact that R / X = 0.24 = κ = 1.5 i pMB =×× = 15 2 7 . ,440 15,800 A . Taking the motors into account, the short-circuit current (subtransient) on the main LV switchboard increases from 35,070 A to 42,510 A and the peak ipB from 72,400 A to 88,200 A. However, as mentioned above, if the fault arc is taken into account, IB is reduced between 21.3 to 34 kA. c Fault at A (HV side) Rather than calculating the equivalent impedances, it is easier to estimate (conservatively) the reverse current of the motors at A by multiplying the value at B by the LV / HV transformation value 17 , i.e.: 7,440 410 20 10 152.5 A 3 × × = This figure, compared to the 6,415 A calculated previously, is negligible Rough calculation of the fault at D This calculation makes use of all the approximations mentioned above (notably 15 and 16 .

Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.23 3 Calculation of Isc values in a radial network using symmetrical components 3.1 Advantages of this method Calculation using symmetrical components is particularly useful when a three-phase network is unbalanced, because, due to magnetic phenomena, for example, the traditional “cyclical” impedances R and X are, normally speaking, no longer useable. This calculation method is also required when: c A voltage and current system is not symmetrical (Fresnel vectors with different moduli and imbalances exceeding 120°).This is the case for phase-to-earth or phase-to-phase short-circuits with or without earth connection c The network includes rotating machines and/or special transformers (Yyn connection, for example) This method may be used for all types of radial distribution networks at all voltage levels. 3.2 Symmetrical components Similar to the Leblanc theorem which states that a rectilinear alternating field with a sinusoidal amplitude is equivalent to two rotating fields turning in the opposite direction, the definition of symmetrical components is based on the equivalence between an unbalanced threephase system and the sum of three balanced threephase systems, namely the positivesequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence (see Fig. 23 ). The superposition principle may then be used to calculate the fault currents. In the description below, the system is defined using current Ι1 as the rotation reference, where: c Ι1(1) is the positive-sequence component c Ι1(2) is the negative-sequence component c Ι1 (0) is the zero-sequence component and by using the following operator a = e = - 1 2 j 3 2 j 2 3 π + between I1, I2, and I3. This principle, applied to a current system, is confirmed by a graphical representation (see fig. 23). For example, the graphical addition of the vectors produces, for, the following result: Ι Ι ΙΙ 2 1 = ++ a a 1 1 2 (1) (2) (3) . Currents Ι1and Ι3 may be expressed in the same manner, hence the system: ΙΙ Ι Ι 1 1 =+ + (1) (2) (0) a 1 1 Ι Ι ΙΙ 2 1 = ++ a a 1 1 2 (1) (2) (0) Ι Ι ΙΙ 3 1 = a + a 1 + 1 (1) (2) (0) 2 .

Among these characteristics, we can note that Z(2) ≈ Z(1), except for rotating machines, whereas Z(0) varies depending on each element (see Fig. 24 ). For further information on this subject, a detailed presentation of this method for calculating solid and impedance fault currents is contained in the “Cahier Technique” n° 18 (see the appended bibliography). 3.3 Calculation as defined by IEC 60909 Standard IEC 60909 defines and presents a method implementing symmetrical components, that may be used by engineers not specialised in the field. The method is applicable to electrical networks with a nominal voltage of less than 550 kV and the standard explains the calculation of minimum and maximum short-circuit currents. The former is required in view of calibrating overcurrent protection devices and the latter is used to determine the rated characteristics for the electrical equipment. Procedure 1- Calculate the equivalent voltage at the fault location, equal to c Un / 3 where c is a voltage factor required in the calculation to account for: c Voltage variations in space and in time c Possible changes in transformer tappings c Subtransient behaviour of generators and motors Depending on the required calculations and the given voltage levels, the standardised voltage levels are indicated in Figure 25 . 2- Determine and add up the equivalent positivesequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence impedances upstream of the fault location. 3- Calculate the initial short-circuit current using the symmetrical components. Practically speaking and depending on the type of fault, the equations required for the calculation of the Isc are indicated in the table in Figure 26 . 4- Once the rms value of the initial short-circuit current (I" k) is known, it is possible to calculate the other values: ip, peak value, Ib, rms value of the symmetrical short-circuit breaking current, idc, aperiodic component, Ik, rms value of the steady-state short-circuit current. Effect of the distance separating the fault from the generator When using this method, two different possibilities must always be considered: c The short-circuit is far from the generator, the situation in networks where the short-circuit currents do not have a damped, alternating component This is generally the case in LV networks, except when high-power loads are supplied by special HV substations; c The short-circuit is near the generator (see fig. 11), the situation in networks where the short-circuit currents do have a damped, alternating component. This generally occurs in HV systems, but may occur in LV systems when, for example, an emergency generator supplies priority outgoers.

Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.25 The main differences between these two cases are: c For short-circuits far from the generator v The initial (I" k), steady-state (Ik) and breaking (Ib) short-circuit currents are equal (I" k = Ik = Ib) v The positive-sequence (Z(1)) and negative sequence (Z(2)) impedances are equal (Z(1) = Z(2)) Note however that asynchronous motors may also add to a short-circuit, accounting for up to 30% of the network Isc for the first 30 milliseconds, in which case I" k = Ik = Ib no longer holds true. Conditions to consider when calculating the maximum and minimum short-circuit currents c Calculation of the maximum short-circuit currents must take into account the following points v Application of the correct voltage factor c corresponding to calculation of the maximum short-circuit currents v Among the assumptions and approximations mentioned in this document, only those leading to a conservative error should be used v The resistances per unit length RL of lines (overhead lines, cables, phase and neutral conductors) should be calculated for a temperature of 20 °C c Calculation of the minimum short-circuit currents requires v Applying the voltage factor c corresponding to the minimum permissible voltage on the network v Selecting the network configuration, and in some cases the minimum contribution from sources and network feeders, which result in the lowest short-circuit current at the fault location v Taking into account the impedance of the busbars, the current transformers, etc. v Considering resistances RL at the highest foreseeable temperature R C L e - 20 C x RL20 . = + ° ( ° )       1 0 004 θ where RL20 is the resistance at 20 °C; θe is the permissible temperature (°C) for the conductor at the end of the short-circuit.

Note that this current is used to determine the breaking capacity of these circuit breakers. This current may be calculated with a fair degree of accuracy using the following equation: Ib = µ . I" k where: where µ = is a factor defined by the minimum time delay tmin and the I" k / Ir ratio (see Fig. 27 ) which expresses the influence of the subtransient and transient reactances, with Ir as the rated current of the generator. Steady-state short-circuit current Ik The amplitude of the steady-state short-circuit current Ik depends on generator saturation influences and calculation is therefore less accurate than for the initial symmetrical curren I" k. The proposed calculation methods produce a sufficiently accurate estimate of the upper and lower limits, depending on whether the shortcircuit is supplied by a generator or a synchronous machine. c The maximum steady-state short-circuit current, with the synchronous generator at its highest excitation, may be calculated by: Ikmax = λmax Ir c The minimum steady-state short-circuit current is calculated under no-load, constant (minimum) excitation conditions for the synchronous generator and using the equation: Ikmin = λmin Ir λ is a factor defined by the saturated synchronous reactance Xd sat.

A number of these methods were initially designed in such a way that short-circuit currents could be calculated by hand or using a small calculator. Over the years, the standards have been revised and the methods have often been modified to provide greater accuracy and a better representation of reality. However, in the process, they have become more complicated and time-consuming, as is demonstrated by the recent changes in IEC 60909, where hand calculations are possible only for the most simple cases. With the development of ever more sophisticated computerised calculations, electrical-installation designers have developed software meeting their particular needs. Today, a number of software packages comply with the applicable standards, for example Ecodial, a program designed for low-voltage installations and marketed by Schneider Electric. All computer programs designed to calculate short-circuit currents are predominantly concerned with: c Determining the required breaking and making capacities of switchgear and the electromechanical withstand capabilities of equipment c Determining the settings for protection relays and fuse ratings to ensure a high level of discrimination in the electrical network Other software is used by experts specialising in electrical network design, for example to study the dynamic behaviour of electrical networks. Such computer programs can be used for precise simulations of electrical phenomena over time and their use is now spreading to include the entire electro-mechanical behaviour of networks and installations. Remember, however, that all software, whatever its degree of sophistication, is only a tool. To ensure correct results, it should be used by qualified professionals who have acquired the relevant knowledge and experience.

Although their backgrounds and professional skills are similar, chemical engineers work in a wide variety of industries, in addition to chemicals and petroleum, such as: Biotechnology Lime and cement Consulting Man-made fibers Drugs and pharmaceuticals Metallurgical and metal products Fats and oils Paints, varnishes, and pigments Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals Pesticides and herbicides Environment Waste water treatment All the industries as mentioned above are involving numerous of chemical process unit. Therefore, chemical engineers play an important role on design, operation, control, troubleshooting, research and management in the chemical process. Chemical process is a combination of process equipment designed to efficiently convert raw materials into finished or intermediate products. Figure 1 shows the example of chemical processes converting the raw material into desired product. Figure 1.1: Chemical process 1.2 Units and Dimensions “What are units and dimensions and how do they differ?” Dimensions are basic concepts of measurement such as length (L), mass (M), time (t), temperature (T), amount of substance (n) and so on. Besides, units are the mean of expressing the dimensions as feet or centimeters for length, or hours or seconds for time. By attaching units to all numbers that are not fundamentally dimensionless, you are able to easy interrelating the physical meaning to the numbers use. Moreover, a logical 1 approach to the problem rather than remembering a formula and plugging numbers could also help the chemical engineers in engineering calculation. SI units are universally accepted for engineering calculation. Thus, American engineering system (based on British standards) is still used extensively in the U.S. Example 1.1 What are the dimensions of mass flux (mass flow rate per unit area perpendicular to the flow)? G A dm dt = 1 L t M 2 dimensions are The rules for handling units are essentially quite simple by addition, subtraction or equality. ¾ Values could be added if UNITS are the same. ¾ Values cannot be added if DIMENSIONS are different. Example 1.2 (i) 6 ft + 10 0 C =??? * Different dimensions: length, temperature -- cannot be added * Same dimension: length, different units -- can add 2 Table 1.1: SI Units Physical Quantity Name of Unit Symbol for Unit* Definition of Unit Basic SI Units Length metre, meter m Mass kilogramme, kilogram kg Time second s Temperature kelvin K Amount of substance mole mol Derived Sl Units Energy joule J kg.m2 .s -2 Force newton N kg.m.s-2 = J.m-1 Power watt W kg.m2 .s-3 = J.s-1 Density kilogram per cubic meter kg.m-3 Velocity meter per second rn.s -1 Acceleration meter per second squared rn.s-2 Pressure newton per square meter, pascal N.m-2, Pa Heat Capacity joule per (kilogram - kelvin) J.kg-1 ,K-1 Alternative Units Time minute, hour, day, year min, h, d, y Temperature degree Celsius °C Mass tonne, ton (Mg), gram t, g Volume litre, liter (dm3 ) L Table 1.2: American Engineering System Units Physical Quantity Name of Unit Symbol Basic Units Length feet ft Mass pound (mass) lbm Force pound (force) lbf Time second, hour s, hr Temperature degree Rankine °R Derived Units Energy British thermal unit, foot pound (force) Btu, (ft)(lbf) Power horsepower hp Density pound (mass) per cubic foot lbm/ft3 Velocity feet per second ft/s Acceleration feet per second squared ft/s2 Pressure pound (force) per square inch lbf/in2 Heat capacity Btu per pound (mass) per degree F Btu/lbm. 0 F 3 1.3 Conversion of Units Conversion factors are statements of equivalent values of different units in the same system or between systems of units. The concept is to multiply any number and its associated units with dimensionless ratios termed conversion factors to arrive at desired answer and its associated units. The factors for conversion units are show in table 1.3.

The specific volume of a substance is the volume occupied by a unit mass of the substance; it is the inverse of density.

In this section we will review different ways to express mixture compositions and also outline the methods o fr 1 The atomic weight of an element is the mass of an atom on a scale that assigns. The atomic weights of all the elements in their naturally isotopic proportions are listed in the table given. The molecular weight of a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms that constitute a molecule of the compound: For example atomic oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16 and therefore molecular oxygen (O2) has a molecular weight of approximately 32. A gram-mole (g-mole or mol in SI units) of a 9 species is the amount of that species whose mass in grams is numerically equal to its molecular weight. Hence, one g-mole of any species co Avogadro’s number) molecules of that species. ntains approximately 6.02x1023 example, and therefore there is 454 ol/lb-mole, regardless of the substance involved. xample 1.7 ow many of each of the following are contained in 100g of CO2 (M=44.01)? i.

Thus, iii. mol C 2.273 mol C ( Moreover, there are other types of moles such as kg-moles, lb-moles, and ton-moles. For example: Carbon monoxide (CO) has a molecular weight of 28; 1 mol of CO therefore contains 28g, 1 lb-mole contains 28 lbm, 1 ton-mole contains 28 tons and so on. Besides, the same factors used to convert masses from a unit to another can also be used to convert the equivalent molar units: there is 454 g/lb for m 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 E H = 2.273 m l CO o 2 1 lb-mol Each molecules of CO2 contains one atom of C, one molecule of O2 or two atoms of O.

They are almost always prerequisite to all other calculations in the solution of process engineering problems. Material balances are nothing more than the application of the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed. Thus, as an example, you cannot specify an input to a reactor of one ton of naphtha and an output of two tons of gasoline or gases or anything else. One ton of total material in o A material balance is an accounting for material. Thus, material balances are often compared to the balancing of current accounts.

If a system is not rising or falling, then ∆ EP = 0. 3. If a system and its surroundings are at the same temperature or the system is perfectly insulated, then Q = 0. The process is then termed adiabatic. 4. Work done on or by a closed system is accomplished by movement of the system boundary against a resisting force or the passage of an electrical current or radiation across the system boundary. If there no moving parts or electrical current at the system boundary, then W = 0. en System is done on the surrounding by mass that emerges from the systems. ` Both work terms must be include in the energy balance for open system. 3.7 Energy Balances on Op ` In open system, mass is transferred across the system boundaries while the process is taking place. ` Therefore work must be done on open system to push mass in and work 38 ` he net ork d y an open system; process fluid on a moving part within the d at the system outlet minus rate of ol is used to denote the specific property (property divided by mass or by T w one b where; & - shaft work (rate of work done by the WS system such as a pump rotor.) & - flow work (rate of work done by the flui Wfl work done by the fluid at the system inlet.) ` ^ symb mole) such as specific internal energy (U ) kJ/kg), specific volume ( V ) m3 /kg) and so on. ` ne important property for energy balance on open system is specific enthalpy ( O Hˆ kJ/kg). ` Sometimes, universal gas law constant can be used as a conversion factor to cific enthalpy. of helium at this temperature and pressure, and the rate at which enthalpy is ansported by a stream of helium at 300 K and 1 atm with a molar flowrate of 250 Solution: o convert L.atm/mol into J/mol, we need the factor J/(L.atm).

The phase diagram shows, in pressure-temperature space, 41 the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas. The phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the critical point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable, in what is known as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around Tc=647.096 K (1,164.773 °R), pc=22.064 MPa (3,200.1 psi) and ρc=356 kg/m³.

Change in P, at constant T & constant state of aggregation. 2. Change in T, at constant T & constant state of aggregation. 3. Phase changes at constant T & constant P. 4. Mixing at constant T & constant P. 5. Chemical reaction at constant T & constant P. 4.2 Hypothetical Process Path ` State properties o Properties that depend on the state of the species (primarily on its temperature and state of aggregation, and to lesser extent on its pressure). o Specific enthalpy ( Hˆ ) and specific internal energy ( Uˆ ) are state properties species. o When a species passes from one state to another state, both Δ Hˆ and ΔUˆ for the process are independent of the path taken from the first state to the second state. ` We can construct a hypothetical process path which can consist of several step based on our convenience, as long as we reach to the final state starting from their initial state. ` For example, the enthalpy change (Δ Hˆ ) of solid phenol at 25 o C and 1 atm to phenol vapor at 300 o C and 3 atm. H phenol Δ ˆ = (vapor, 300˚C, 3 atm) – (solid, 25˚C, 1 atm) o Cannot determine directly from enthalpy table – must use hypothetical process path consist of several step. o Check Table of Physical Properties Data Appendix 5: P= 1 atm; Tm= 42.5°C and Tb= 181.4°C 46 1 2 3 4 5 6 Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ+Δ=Δ HHHHHHH ˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ 4.3 Procedure Energy Balance Calculations 1. Perform all required material balance calculations. 2. Write the appropriate form of the energy balance (closed or open system) and delete any of the terms that are either zero or negligible for the given process system. 3. Choose a reference state – phase, temperature, and pressure – for each species involved in the process. 4. Construct inlet-outlet table for specific internal energy (close system) or specific enthalpy (close system) { For closed system, construct a Table with columns for initial and final amounts of each species (mi or ni) and specific internal energies (Uˆ ) relative to the chosen reference states. { For an open system, construct a table with columns for inlet and outlet stream component flow rates (mi or ni) and specific enthalpies ( Hˆ ) relative to the chosen references states. 5. Calculate all required values of Hˆ or Uˆ and insert the values in the appropriate places in the table. Then calculate Δ Hˆ or ΔUˆ for the system. 6. Calculate any work, kinetic energy, or potential energy terms that you have not dropped from the energy balance. 7.

Heat transfer is thermal energy in transit due to a temperature difference. In other words, heat transfer is to predict the energy transfer between material bodies. [In the simplest of terms, the discipline of heat transfer is concerned with only two things: temperature, and the flow of heat. Temperature represents the amount of thermal energy available, whereas heat flow represents the movement of thermal energy from place to place.] o How Science of heat transfer explain: ¾ How heat energy may be transfer? ¾ Predict the rate at which the exchange will take place? ¾ Different between thermodynamics and heat transfer ? o Thermodynamics deal with system in equilibrium, it may used to predict of energy required to change a system from one equilibrium state to another. But it does not predict how fast a change will take place. Example 6.1 Consider the cooling of a hot steel bar which is placed in a pail of water. Thermodynamics may used to predict the final equilibrium temperature of steel bar-water combination. However, thermodynamics will not tell: ¾ how long to reach the equilibrium or, ¾ what the temperature of steel bar after certain length of time? 67 Table 6.1: Comparison between heat transfer and thermodynamics HEAT TRANSFER THERMODYNAMICS • Heat transfer is a study which predicts the energy transfer which takes place between material bodies. • It is due to the temperature difference • Heat transfer explains how heat energy may be transferred. • It also predicts the rate at which the exchange will take place under certain condition. • Thermodynamics deals with systems in equilibrium. • Thermodynamics may used to predict the amount of energy required to change a system from one equilibrium state to another. • Thermodynamics may not used to predict how fast a change will take place since the system is not in equilibrium during the process. Three modes of heat transfer are: (1) Conduction (2) Convection (3) Radiation 6.2 Conduction Heat Transfer o Energy transfer from high temperature region to low temperature region. We said that the energy is transferred by conduction. And, the heat transfer rate per unit area is proportional to the normal temperature gradient. q/A ~ dT/dx where, q/A = heat transfer rate (W/m2 ) dT/dx = temperature gradient in the direction of the heat flow When proportionality constant is inserted, q = - kA dT/dx [6.1] o The positive constant k = thermal conductivity of the material. The minus (-) sign is inserted so that the second principle of thermodynamics will be satisfied i.e. heat must flow downhill on the temperature scale as indicated in Figure 6.1. 68 Equation (8.0) is called Fourier’s Law of heat conduction. Above is defining equation for the thermal conductivity and k has the unit of Watts per meter per Celsius degree (W/m.0 C), which the heat flow is expressed in watts. Figure 6.1: Sketch showing direction of heat flow Table 6.2: Lists typical values of the thermal conductivities of some metal (thermal conductivity at 300 K(W/m K)). Metal k Copper, pure 396 Aluminium 238 Carbon steel, 1% C 42 Plastics 0.2 - 0.3 Air 0.026 69 Figure 6.2: One –dimensional plane wall o Consider the one-dimensional plane wall shown in Figure above, if the system in a steady state, i.e., if the temperature does not change with time, then only integrate Equation (8.0) and substitute the appropriate values. 1 0 2 x T T q dx kdT A = ∫ ∫ o Where temperature at the left face (x=0) is uniform at T1 and the temperature at right face is uniform at T2. If k is independent of T, we obtain after integration : 2 q T T 1 k A L − = − o Under the steady state conditions, where the distribution is linear, the temperature gradient may be expressed as: T T 2 1 dT dx L − = o And the heat transfer rate: T T 2 1 q k A L − = − or; T T 1 2 q T k k A L L − Δ = = 70 o Since dT/dx = - q/k for the same q, if k is low (i.e: for an insulator), dT/dx will be large .i.e. there will be a large temperature difference across the wall, and if k is high (i.e. for a conductor), dT/dx will be small, or there will be a small temperature difference across the wall. Example 6.2 One face of a copper plate 3 cm thick is maintained at 400 °C, and the other face maintained at 100 °C. How much heat is transferred through the plate? Given: k = 370 W/m.K. From Fourier’s Law, q d k A d = − T x Integrating gives ( ) 2 370 / . (100 400) 3 10 q T W mK K k A x m− Δ − − =− = Δ × q/A = 3.7 MW/m 2 6.3 Convection Heat Transfer o It is well known that hot plate of metal will cool faster when placed in front of a fan than when exposed to still air. We say that, heat is convected away, and we call the process, convection heat transfer. The velocity at which the air blows over the hot plate obviously influence the heat transfer rate. 6.3.1 Mechanism of convection o Consider the heated plate shown on Figure 8.3. Temperature of plate is Tw and temperature of the fluid is T∞. The velocity of the flow will appear as shown in the figure. 71 Figure 6.3: Convection heat transfer from a plate o The velocity is being reduced to zero at the plate as a result of viscous action. Since the velocity of fluid layer at the wall will be zero, the heat must be transferred only by conduction. Thus we might compute the heat transfer, using: q = -kA (dT/dx) but with little changes. We use thermal conductivity of fluid and the fluid temperature gradient at the wall.The temperature gradient is dependent on the rate at which the fluid carries the heat away. High velocity produces a large temperature gradient. Thus, the temperature gradient at the wall depends on the flow field. To express the overall effect of convection, we use Newton’s law of cooling: q = hA (Tw-T∞) [6.2] where, h = convection heat-transfer coefficient (heat-transfer coefficient = film conductance) h = watt per square meter per Celsius degree (W/m² .°C) when the heat flow is in Watt. o Heat-transfer rate is related to overall temperature difference between the wall and fluid and the surface area. 6.3.2 Free and Forced Convection o If heated plate were exposed to ambient room air without an external source of motion, a movement of the air would be experienced as a result of the density gradients near the plate. o We call this as free convection. When the mass motion of the fluid is caused by an external device like a pump, compressor, blower or fan, the process is called forced convection. Example 6.3 72 Air at 20 °C blows over a hot plate 50 by 75 cm maintained at 250 °C. The convection heat transfer coefficient is 25 W/m².°C. Calculate the heat transfer? Solution: From Newton’s Law of cooling; ( ) w q hA T T = − ∞ q = (25)W/m2 .K (0.5x0.75) m2 (250-20)K q = 2.156 kW Example 6.4 An electric current is passed through a wire 1 mm in diameter and 10 cm long. The wire is submerged in liquid water at atmospheric pressure, and the current is increased until the water boils. For this situation h = 5000 W/m².°C, and the water temperature will be 100 °C. How much electric power must be supplied to the wire to maintain the wire surface at 114 °C. Solution: Total convection loss is ( ) w q hA T T = − ∞ The surface area of the wire A = πdL = π (1x10 -3 )(10x10 -2 ) = 3.142 x 10 -4 m 2 Therefore, the heat transfer is q = (5000w/m².°C)(3.142 x 10 -4 m²)(114-100) = 21.99 W and this is equal to the electric power which must be applied. 6.4 Radiation Heat Transfer o Heat may also transfer through regions where perfect vacuum exist. The mechanism in this case is electromagnetic radiation which is propagated as a result of a temperature difference. This is called thermal radiation. o This is confirmed by our experienced everyday experience of being warmed by the sun, which separated from the earth by approximately 1.5 x 1011 m of empty space. o Thermal radiation can of course transport through any ‘transparent’ medium such as air. Ideal thermal radiator, or black body, will emit energy at a rate 73 q emitted = σAT4 [6.3] where; σ is the proportionality constant and is called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant with value of 5.669 x 10 -8 W/m 2 .K 4 . o This equation is called Stefan-Boltzmann law of thermal radiation and it apply to only blackbodies. This equation is valid only for thermal radiation; other type of electromagnetic radiation may not be treated so simply. q emitted = σAT4 govern only radiation emitted by a blackbody. The net radian exchange between two surface will be proportional to the difference in absolute temperature to the fourth power. i.e: q net exchange/ A  (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) q net exchange/ A = σ (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) 6.4.1 Blackbody o It is a perfect emitter of radiation. At a particular temperature the blackbody would emit the maximum amount of energy possible for that temperature. o This value is known as the blackbody radiation. It would emit at every wavelength of light as it must be able to absorb every wavelength to be sure of absorbing all incoming radiation. o The maximum wavelength emitted by a blackbody radiator is infinite. It also emits a definite amount of energy at each wavelength for a particular temperature, so standard black body radiation curves can be drawn for each temperature, showing the energy radiated at each wavelength (Fig. 6.4). 74 Figure 6.4: Theoretical black body curve for 5000K o Again, blackbody is a body which radiates energy according to the T 4 law. Other type of surface, such as glossy painted surface or a polished metal plate, do not radiate as much energy as the blackbody. o However, the total radiation emitted by this body still generally follows the T1 4 proportionality. To take account of the “gray” nature of such surfaces we introduce another factor, called the emissivity,  which relates the radiation of the “gray” surface to that of an ideal black surface. In addition, we must take into account the fact that not all the radiation leaving one surface will reach the other surface since electromagnetic radiation travels in straight line and some will lost to the surrounding. o Therefore two new factors in (Eq 8.2)take into account both situation, so that q= F F G σ A (T1 4 - T 2 4 ) [6.4] F = emissivity function F G = geometric “view factor” function A simple radiation problem is encounter when we have a heat-transfer surface at temperature T1 completely enclosed by much larger surface maintained at T2. The net radiant exchange in this case can be calculated with, q =  1 Aσ 1 (T 4 1 - T 4 2 ) where,  1 = emissivity of material Example 6.5 Two infinite black plates at 800 0 C and 300 0 C exchange heat by radiation. Calculate the heat transfer per unit area. Given: σ = 5.669 x 10 -8 W/m 2 .K 4 Solution: q/A = σ (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) = 5.669 X 10 -8 )W/m 2 .K 4 (10734 - 5734)K 4 = 69.03 kW/m 2 75 Problems 1. If 3 kW is conducted through a section of insulating material 0.6 m2 in crosssection and 2.5 cm thick and the thermal conductivity may be taken as 0.2 W/m0 C, compute the temperature difference across the material. 2. A temperature difference of 850 C is impressed across a fiberglass layer of 13 cm thickness. The thermal conductivity of the fiberglass is 0.035 W/m.0 C. Compute the heat transferred through the material per hour per unit area. 3. Two perfectly black surfaces are constructed so that all the radiant energy leaving a surface at 8000 C reaches the other surface. The temperature of the other surface is maintained at 2500 C. Calculate the heat transfer between the surfaces per hour and per unit area of the surface maintained at 8000 C. 4. One side of a plane wall is maintained at 100 C, while the other side is exposed to a convection having T = 100 C and h=10 W/m2.0 C. The wall has k = 1.6 W/m.0 C and is 40 cm thick. Calculate the heat transfer rate through the wall. 0 5. A vertical square plate, 30cm on a side, is maintained at 500 C and exposed to room air at 200 C. The surface emissivity is 0.8. Calculate the total heat lost by both sides of the plate. CHAPTER 7 HEAT EXCHANGERS 7.1 Introduction A heat exchanger is a device that facilitates exchange of heat between two fluids that are at different temperatures and separated by a solid wall. In other words, heat exchangers are devices built for efficient heat transfer from one fluid to another and are widely used in engineering processes. The specific applications of heat exchanger are space heating and air conditioning, power production, waste heat recovery, food and chemical processing, oil refining, and in vehicles. 76 7.2 Heat exchanger types Heat exchangers are classified according to flow arrangement and type of construction.

[Figure7.2a] ƒ In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. Counter current design is more efficient, in that it can transfer more heat [Figure 7.2b]. Figure 7.1: Concentric tube heat exchangers (a) Parallel flow (b) Counterflow Figure 7.2: Concentric tube heat exchangers 77 (b) Cross Flow Heat Exchanger ƒ In a cross-flow heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger. ƒ In finned tubular heat exchangers, the fin-side fluid is unmixed because the fins confine the flow to one direction. Example: automobile radiator. ƒ In unfinned tubular heat exchangers, the fin-side fluid is mixed because the flow in transverse direction is possible.

Solution: To solve this problem we determine a correction factor from Figure x to be used with the LMTF calculated on the basis of a counterflow exchanger.

Cassette based document handling system
Abstract
A cassette (20) for a currency handling system includes a door (28) that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the cassette. An end door (30) is operable to be opened to allow currency that is disposed within the interior of the cassette (20) to be urged outward. The cassette (20) has a locking mechanism disposed in an end (72), which locking mechanism prevents the door from opening until the cassette (20) is disposed in a docking station. Once in the docking station, a paddle (56) is urged downward into the cassette (20) to urge the notes outward therefrom. These notes are moved into a buffer region (58) and then the cassette (20) can be removed to allow another cassette (20) to be disposed therein. This allows a continuous feeding operation. The cassette (20) can then be disposed in a second collection docking station to collect the output of the sorter (41). In this docking station, a paddle (68) is reciprocated downward into the cassette (20) with the collected notes.

Description
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention pertains in general to a document handling system and, more particularly, to a currency handling system that utilizes a cassette for transporting currency between stations.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
After currency is distributed in the public sector, it will typically find its way back into the banking institutions. This is facilitated through individuals depositing currency documents in their local banking institutions, and businesses forwarding their cash receipts to the banking institutions. Once the banking institutions have received the currency in the form of the notes, these notes must then be processed. Although the processing can be facilitated by hand, this is somewhat tedious. To facilitate the large number of notes that must be sorted, counted and then re-bundled or "strapped" for distribution back to the banks, large high speed currency sorting machines have been developed.
Currency sorting machines typically have a feeder slot into which stacks of currency in different denominations and even different sizes can be placed. The currency sorter will then individually strip the notes or documents from the feeder slot, pass them through various sensing stations to determine the denomination of the note and even the quality or integrity of the note. Once this is done, then the sorting machine will deposit the note in a collection slot associated with the proper denomination. Typically, a separate collection slot is provided for notes that are defective due to, for example, a tear or excessive wear. These sorting machines can sort notes at rates up to 2,000 notes per minute.
The disadvantage to present sorting systems is the manner in which the notes must be transported between stations. Typically, there are three stations, the first being the initial hand sorting or collection operation at the original banking institution, the second being the feeder operation to the sorter and the third being the collection operation at the sorter. Due to the high speed nature of the sorter, the sorter typically outstrips the speed at which the documents can be placed into the sorter and then removed from the sorter. Therefore, there exists a need for a system that will facilitate an increase in the throughput.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention disclosed and claimed herein comprises a method and apparatus for transferring documents utilizing a portable cassette having a cover that can be opened to expose the documents or closed in a secured and locked manner to prevent access to documents contained therein. The cassette is loaded at a first station in an open configuration to provide a stack of documents therein, and, after loading, the cassette is locked. The loaded cassette is then transported to a second location in the locked configuration, and then disposed in an unloading docking station.
The loaded cassette is opened to expose at least one end of the stack, and then the stack of documents in the loaded cassette is urged out of the loaded cassette through the at least one end into a buffer region that is continually moving. This allows the contents of the cassette to become part of the documents in the buffer region. The cassette is removed after urging the documents therefrom and after the documents have cleared the at least one end. The unloading operation is then continuously repeated with a new loaded cassette.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a diagrammatic view of the process flow for a document handling system of the present invention, which utilizes a cassette for transporting currency. The process flow is provided by three stations, a hand load station 10, a feeder station 12 and a collection station 14. Initially, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, currency is hand loaded into a cassette. Typically, the cassettes are delivered to a banking institution in an open configuration, there being a locking system that allows the cassette to be placed into a closed and secure configuration. These cassettes are stacked in a compact manner such that an operator can remove the open cassette from the stack, place it on what is referred to as a "desktop station" and then proceed to load the currency therein. Typically, the currency is counted at the banking institution by hand, placed in some type of bundle and then disposed in the cassette. There may be some type of separator card with a bar code disposed thereon which can be utilized at the central banking institution for identification. Once the currency is hand loaded into the cassette, the cassette is then closed and placed in a secure configuration. Once it is in this configuration, it cannot be opened until it is placed onto another docking station that has a key system for unlocking the cassette.
After the cassettes are hand loaded and secured, they are then placed on some type of transport or given to an individual that has the responsibility for the transport. The loaded cassettes are then transported to a sorting facility. The sorting facility contains both the feeder station 12 and the collection station 14. Of course, the sorting facility may be in the next room from the hand loading station 10. At the feeder station 12, the loaded cassettes can be sequentially disposed in the feeder station to allow high speed feeding and high speed sorting. Further, as will be described hereinbelow, this is a continuous feeding operation.
In the continuous feeding operation, a cassette is retrieved from the transport mechanism or the stack and placed onto a docking station associated with the feeding station 12. When it is placed on the docking station, this action unlocks the cassette and allows the door for the cassette to be opened and providing access to the contents. Once access is obtained, then the operator configures the feeding station to urge the notes out of the cassettes and into a buffer region. Once all the bills are urged out of cassette and into the buffer region, the cassette can then be removed in an open position and then a new loaded and locked cassette placed therein and the procedure continues.
Once the cassette is placed into the feeder station 12, the bills that are accessed are placed behind the previous notes in the buffer region. Therefore, the interior of the cassette and the buffer region constitute a feeding supply to the sorting system. The urging of the notes out of the cassette is the same operation that urges the notes in the buffer region up into interface with the sorting mechanism. This is a constant operation with the notes continually urged upward into the sorting mechanism, such that when a new cassette is placed into the feeding mechanism, the previous notes are still in the buffer region to provide a "seamless" feeding operation. The notes are fed at approximately 1,500 notes per minute and a typical cassette will contain about 2,000 notes.
The sorting mechanism is operable to retrieve the notes from the feeding mechanism, evaluate those notes for the integrity of the notes, orientation and also the denomination of the notes. The notes are then "slotted" into different collection slots. The open cassettes are placed into a docking station in the collection slot, similar to the docking station in the feeder slot, and then the notes collected therein. Once the notes are collected, the cassette can then be locked and removed for subsequent processing.
Referring now to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a block diagram of desktop station 16 for use in the hand loading station 10. The desktop station 16 is a box that has a tilted receiving surface 18. The tilted receiving surface 18 is operable to receive a cassette 20 on the surface thereof The desktop station 16 has at the lower end of the surface 18 a tilting door 22, which door 22 is operable to cover a locking mechanism (not shown). The door 22 is spring loaded, such that when the cassette 20 is removed, the door 22 will swing closed to cover the locking mechanism. This provides both a protective cover and a technique to ensure that the cassette 20 will be placed on the surface 18 above the locking mechanism, such that it will be on the same plane as the locking mechanism before engaging the locking mechanism.
The cassette 20 is comprised of a left side 24 and a right side 26. A tambour door 28 is disposed on the cassette 20, such that it can be pulled over the top opening of the cassette 20. An end door 30 is provided on one end thereof which is operable to cover an end opening. Therefore, the door 28 can be slidingly moved over the top opening and a portion of the end opening and, in conjunction with the door 30, completely seal the cassette 20. A window 32 is provided on the right side 26 and a window 36 is provided on the left side 24, which windows 32 and 36 are operable to allow a user to view the interior contents thereof to determine if there are notes in the cassette 20 after locking. A sliding compression panel 38 is provided which slides along the length of the interior of the cassette 20 to allow notes 40 which are disposed between the compression panel 38 and the opening to be stacked tightly within the cassette 20. The operation of the cassette 20 and the interior workings thereof will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
In the operation of the desktop station 16, the cassette 20 is operable to the stored in a stacked configuration with other cassettes 20, all the cassettes 20 being in an open configuration in the preferred embodiment. When a user desires to fill one of the cassettes 20, the open cassette 20 is retrieved from its storage area and disposed on the desktop station 16. It is not necessary for the desktop station 16 to have an interfacing locking mechanism that is disposed under the door 22, but this is available and shown in this embodiment. The only purpose for the mechanism under the door 22 is to provide a key mechanism for unlocking the locking mechanism internal to the cassette 20. Again, this will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
The operator, after disposing the cassette 20 on the desktop station 16, then hand loads the notes 40 into the interior of the cassette between the compression panel 38 and the end opening of the cassette 20. Typically, the compression panel 38 can be moved toward the bottom or opposite end from the open end, to provide access to the full capacity of the cassette 20. Once the notes 40 are loaded into the cassette 20 to the desired capacity, which may be the full capacity, the compression panel 38 is moved toward the open end and the closed door 30 to "pack" the notes and the door 28 is then slidingly moved upward toward the end opening proximate the door 30, this motion then locking the cassette 20 if a corresponding key mechanism is not available, otherwise the cassette 20 must be removed from the desktop station 16 to lock the cassette 20. The cassette 20 is then removed from the desktop station 16 and disposed on a transport mechanism for transport to the next station, the feeder station 12.
Referring now to FIG. 3, there is illustrated a perspective view of a sorting mechanism 41, which FIG. 3 does not illustrate the details of the sorting mechanism 41. However, the sorting mechanism 41 is operable to retrieve documents, such as notes, from a point 42 and deliver them to one of two points 44 or 46, only two delivery points noted for simplicity purposes. The sorting mechanism 41 is conventional and known by those skilled in the art.
The sorting mechanism 41 has a feeder docking station for feeding notes to the point 42 and two collection docking stations for receiving notes delivered to the points 44 and 46, respectively. When the cassette 20 is transported from the desktop station 16, after locking thereof, the cassette 20 is then disposed in the feeder docking station, which is comprised of a buffer region 48 and a docking region 50. The docking region 50 has associated therewith a key mechanism, similar to the key mechanism disposed under the door 22 in the desktop station 16 of FIG. 2. It is operable to be disposed in the docking region 50 and the key mechanism engaged, such that the door 28 can now be slidingly moved down toward the unopen end of the cassette 20 to expose all of the notes therein. The door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface to allow the notes 40 within the cassette 20 to be moved to the buffer region 48, the surface of the cassette 20, the surface of the door 30 and the lower surface of the buffer region 48 being coplanar.
It can be seen in the embodiment of FIG. 3 that there are a plurality of notes 54 that are disposed in the buffer region 48. These notes 54 are urged upward toward the point 42 with the use of a "paddle" 56. The paddle 56 is mounted on a feeding mechanism 58, which feeding mechanism 58 is operable to reciprocate the paddle along the length of the docking region 50 and buffer region 48. The paddle 56, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, is operable to be reciprocated upward and moved down into the unopen end of the cassette 20 and then pushed down into the cassette 20. It is only necessary for the paddle 56 to rise up high enough to clear the sides of the cassette 20.
In operation, the embodiment of FIG. 3 is illustrated wherein the notes 54 and the buffer region were previously fed in from prior cassette 20. The paddle 56 therefore had cleared the prior cassette and is fully within the buffer region 48, continually urging the notes 54 upward to the point 42. This urging of the notes 54 upward to the point 42 allows the sorting mechanism to strip the notes off. This stripping operation operates at approximately 1,500 notes per minute. When the new cassette 20 is disposed within the docking region 50, the operator in one embodiment then urges the notes 40 upward against the back surface of the paddle 56 and then moves the paddle 56 out of contact with the notes 54 in the buffer region 48 and then moves it vertically upward from the surface of the feeder station and then urges it downward along the length of the feeder station toward the closed end of the cassette 20 until it is proximate to the bottom of the notes 40. The paddle 56 is then engaged with the bottom of the notes 40, such that the notes 40 and the notes 54 now comprise one stack of notes. The paddle 56 then automatically urges the entire combined stack of notes 40 and 54 upward to the point 42. As soon as sufficient notes have been stripped off the top of the combined stack and the combined stack clears the cassette 20, the cassette 20 can be removed and another cassette provided. During this removal, the cassette 20 is allowed to remain open.
In the next operation, the operator will proceed to the next station, the collection station. In this mode, the cassette 20 is disposed within one of the collection docking stations. Each of the collection docking stations has a buffer region 60 and a docking region 62. The buffer region 60 is typically smaller than the buffer region 48, approximately six inches, but it has a similar key device as the feeder docking station in the event that a closed cassette is disposed therein. Once disposed in the docking region 62, the door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface. A feeding mechanism 64 is provided that runs along the length of both buffer region 60 and docking region 62 and has a paddle 68 associated therewith. The paddle 68 is operable to reciprocate downward from the associated one of the points 44-46 as notes are fed therein and will move downward into the associated cassette 20. Once the sorter has determined that the capacity of the cassette 20 has been reached, i.e., the desired note count, it will discontinue routing notes to that particular collection location. The user will then remove the cassette 20, close the door 28 and then store the notes. Typically, there will be some type of bar code for identification purposes on a particular cassette which can be entered into a computer to provide some type of tracking ability. A reader could be implemented for automatically reading the bar code as the cassette is disposed on its associated feeder docking station, collection docking station, or desktop station.
Referring now to FIG. 4, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 in the open position. Each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed around the peripheral edges on the inner side thereof a slot 70 which is a guide slot for the door 28. An end cap 72 is provided to cover the locking mechanism (not shown) and has two groups of three key access holes 74 and 76. The end cap 72 covers the end portion of the door 28 also. However, one of its primary functions is to hide the key mechanism to prevent unlocking of the system and also to protect the locking mechanism.
Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, there are illustrated side views of the left and right sides 24 and 26, respectively. Each of the left and right sides 24 and 26 have associated therewith a rack 78 with a surface extending upward. Each of these racks 78 is operable to interface with a toothed gear 80, as shown in FIG. 4. The left side 24 has disposed below the rack 78 a horizontal slot 84 that runs along the length of the rack 78, whereas the right side 26 has disposed below the rack 78 a plurality of vertical slots 86. The horizontal slot 84 is a guide slot for the compression panel 38, whereas the vertical slots 86 are locking slots, as will be described hereinbelow. In addition, each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed in the open end thereof a slot 90 and a slot 92, respectively, with each of the slots 90 and 92 having a detent 94 associated therewith. The detent 94 is operable to receive a pan head pin 96 on the right side of the door 30, the slot 90 operable to receive a similar pan head pin (not shown). The door 30, as will be described hereinbelow, is operable to reciprocate vertically in the closed position, such that the pin 96 can reciprocate downward into the detent 94. The left and right sides 24 and 26 are fabricated from a plastic material and the pan head pin 96 extends outward over the edge of the slot 90, it being a large diameter, such that it will prevent an individual from prying the sides 24 and 26 apart, gaining entrance thereto and then placing them back together. As will be described hereinbelow, when the door 28 is closed, it overlaps the door 30, preventing it from reciprocating upward and the pan head pin 96 rotating out of the slot 92.
Referring now to FIG. 7, there is illustrated an end view of the compression panel 38. The compression panel 38 is manufactured of a flat metal sheet having disposed on one side thereof a guide pin 100, proximate to the left side 24 and, on the other side thereof, a protrusion 102. The guide pin 100 is operable to be disposed within the guide slot 84 and the protrusion 102 is operable to fit within each of the slots 86 on the right side 26. The gears 80 are operable to be disposed within a slot 106 that has the rack 78 disposed therein and is proximate to the transparent window 32. Only the left side 24 is illustrated. The gears 80 are connected together through a shaft 108, the gears 80 fixedly attached to the shaft 108. In this manner, both gears 80 on either end of the shaft 108 are co-rotatable. The compression panel 38 is slidingly engaged with the shaft 108, such that it can slide in either direction and pivot about the shaft 108. A spring 110 is disposed between the edge of the compression panel 38 and the gear 80 proximate to the left side 24, such that the panel 38 is urged away from the guide slot 84.
In order to move the panel 38, the panel 38 is urged toward the slot 84, such that the guide pin 100 will be inserted in the slot 84. As this happens, the protrusion 102 is moved away from the right side 26 and the slots 86, thus allowing the panel 38 to be urged along the length of the cassette. When the panel 38 is at the appropriate position, the panel 38 is allowed to be moved away from the left side 24 and toward the right side 26 by the spring 110, such that the protrusion 102 will be inserted into one of the slots 86. Typically, this requires some manual manipulation.
The purpose for the fixed configuration of the shaft 108 and the two gears 80 is to prevent the panel 38 from skewing relative to a perpendicular orientation along the path of travel. Therefore, when the panel 38 is urged along the length of the cassette 20, both gears 80 must rotate and maintain a perpendicular orientation.
Referring now to FIG. 8, there is illustrated a detail of the open end showing the door 30 in an open position. The door 30 has associated with the left side a pan head pin 98 for interfacing with the slot 90. The door 30 is operable to rotate about hinges 112, which hinges 112 are asymmetrical, i.e., they are not round. This allows the door 30 to reciprocate in the planar surface thereof. This will allow the door 30 to reciprocate outward away from the pivoting area of the hinges 112, such that the narrow portion of the pan head pins 96 and 98 can insert in the slots 92 and 90, respectively, and then down into the detents 94. On the outermost edge of the door 30, there are provided two slots 114. The slots 114 are operable to interface with corresponding protrusions (not shown) on the docking station.
Referring now to FIG. 9, there is illustrated a side view of the door 30 in a closed position. The door 30 has a recess area 116 on the outer surface thereof which is operable to contain a handle 118. The handle 118 is operable to rotate about a pivot point 120 away from the recess area 116 and extend outward, as illustrated in FIG. 9. This allows the cassette 20 to be picked up. The pivot point 120 is disposed on a vertical protrusion 121 that extends outward from the door 30. A second protrusion 123 is also provided proximate to the end of the door 30 and having a lower height than the protrusion 121. The handle 118 has a pin 125 disposed thereon proximate to the pivot point 120 and slightly outward therefrom. The pin 125 is operable to fit within a recess 127 when the door 30 is closed. When the handle 118 is swung outward from the recess 116, the pin 125 contacts the upper surface of the recess 127 and forces the door 30 downward, such that the pin 98 is forced down into the detent 94. The two perpendicular protrusions 121 and 123 on the surface of the door 30 with the end of the door 28 (not shown) provide an overlap. The protrusions 121 and 123 prevent a would-be thief from slipping a note around the interface between the door 30 and the door 28.
Referring now to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a detail of the feeder docking station. At the feeder docking station, the cassette 20 is disposed in the cassette region 50 just below the buffer region 48. As noted above, the buffer region 48 is approximately equal to the length of the cassette region 50. The feeder mechanism 58 is comprised of a rod 130 that runs along the length of the feeder docking station. A reciprocating device 132 is disposed on the rod 130 and is attached to the paddle 56. The paddle 56 is operable to extend up over the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The reciprocating device 132 is interfaced with a chain 136, the chain constituting a part of the chain drive which is driven by a chain drive mechanism 138 on one end, the upper end, and a pulley mechanism 140 at the opposite end. The chain 136 moves in one direction. The reciprocating mechanism 132 has a release lever associated therewith (not shown) to allow it to be released. This is conventional in a sorter mechanism. Therefore, the reciprocating device 132 can be manually pulled down to a position beneath a group of notes 142.
As noted above, the cassette 20 is disposed in the feeder docking station after a previous cassette has been in the feeder docking station a sufficient amount of time for the paddle 56 to have been reciprocated upward and out of the cassette 20. When the new cassette 20 is disposed in the docking station, the end thereof is interfaced with a plurality of keys 146 that interface with the key slots 74 and 76. Once in the feeder docking station, the door 28 can be opened and door 30 then swiveled outward from the open end. At this point, the paddle 56 is at a location that is higher in the feeder docking station than the open end of the cassette 20. Since a typical cassette holds approximately 2,000 notes, there will be approximately 2,000 notes in the buffer region 48 when a cassette 20 is removed. At a feed rate of 1,500 notes per minute, it requires that a new cassette be disposed in the feeder docking station within less than approximately 1.5 minutes. Since the paddle 56 is reciprocating upward, the notes in the cassette 20 must be urged upward to contact the notes in the buffer region 50 and then the paddle 56 disposed behind the combined groups of notes. This can be done by two methods. In the first method, the user can push the notes in the buffer region upward to maintain a constant pressure thereon and then tilt the paddle 56 by rotating it after releasing it from the chain drive and then sliding it down the rod 130 to a point behind the notes in the cassette 20. The paddle 56 can then be utilized to slide the notes upward until they contact the notes in the buffer region 50, at which time the paddle 56 is then re-engaged with the chain drive. A second method is to urge the notes in the cassette upward from the cassette 20 to contact the back of the paddle 56, this being a manual operation. Thereafter, the user can hold these notes in place, rotate the paddle 56 upward and then place it behind the combined notes in the cassette and the ones previously in the buffer region 48. Thereafter, the operator waits for the notes to be urged completely out of the cassette 20 and then a new cassette placed in the feeder docking station. This is therefore a continuous and seamless operation to the sorter. In order to insure that the operation is continuous, the drive mechanism 138 provides a constant pressure on the notes. This is facilitated through the use of a pressure switch (not shown), which prevents too much pressure being placed on the notes with the paddle 56 or a direct drive motor. Either method is acceptable.
In order to facilitate removal of the cassette 20, a removal lever 150 is provided having an actuating arm 152. The actuating arm 152 is operable to be actuated and to cause the door 30 (not shown) to be urged upward, allowing the user to then complete door closing.
Referring now to FIG. 11, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 disposed in the collection docking station. The collection docking station is substantially similar to the feeder docking station, with the exception that it operates in the reverse end that it does not have as large a buffer region. The buffer region is approximately 6 inches, less than the length of a cassette 20. In this mechanism, the paddle 68 is reciprocated along a rod (not shown) similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. A reciprocating block 154 is provided which is operable to reciprocate along this rod (not shown). The reciprocating block 154 is interfaced with an engaging member that contacts the side of a toothed belt 156, the toothed belt 156 being disposed on an idler pulley 158, that is toothed, and to a toothed drive pulley 160 on the other end. Drive pulley 160 is driven by a belt drive motor 164. The blade 68 is operable to reciprocate upward a sufficient vertical distance to clear notes 168 that are disposed in the collection docking station. The paddle 68 can then be disengaged with the belt 56 and reciprocated to a desired position.
The operation is such that notes, after the sorting operation, are routed to the particular collection docking station in which the cassette 20 resides and are, via gravity, disposed therein. The surface of the collection docking station is at approximately a forty five degree angle. When the paddle is reciprocated up to the closest position to the sorting mechanism, the notes will be disposed in the sorter and, in response to notes coming into the particular collection docking station, the belt drive motor 164 will increment the belt 156 and reciprocate the paddle 68 down toward the lower end of the collection docking station, which is also the closed end of the cassette 20, when the cassette 20 is disposed in the collection docking station. As will be described hereinbelow, there are sensors that sense when the paddle 68 approaches the cassette 20 and, a switch associated with the cassette 20 being in place will be sensed. If this switch is set, indicating a cassette 20 is disposed therein, the operation will continue and the blade 68 will move downward. Once a sufficient number of notes to fill the capacity of the cassette 20 have been disposed at a particular collection station, the paddle 68 will then be moved downward in the cassette 20, the paddle 68 reciprocated vertically upward and then moved all the way to the top, such that new notes coming into the collection docking station can then be disposed on the upper surface of the paddle 68. The cassette 20 can then have the door thereof closed, and then removed from the collection docking station. A new empty cassette is then disposed therein. Typically, as described above, the cassette 20 is already open. However, the locking keys (not shown) are disposed on the collection docking station to allow the cassette 20 be in an unlocked position and thereafter allow the door 28 to be slidingly moved upward for closure.
Referring now to FIG. 12, there is illustrated a side view of the paddle 68 and the reciprocating member 154. The paddle 68 has a lower flat surface 170, which contacts the notes 168. An extending arm 172 extends upward over the right side 24 of the cassette 20 and downward to a vertically reciprocating arm 174. The vertically reciprocating arm 174 reciprocates within a slide bracket 176. Slide bracket 176 is attached to the reciprocating member 154, reciprocating member 154 having a cylindrical bore 178 disposed therethrough that is operable to reciprocate along the rod that was not shown in FIG. 11 and that is similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. Below the reciprocating member 178 is disposed a toothed block 180, toothed block 180 shown in a side view and operable to interface with the teeth on the inside surface of the belt 156 on the outer band. Whenever it is desired to release the toothed block 180 from the belt 156, it is only necessary to pull up on the arm 172 which will rotate the toothed block 180 away from the surface of the belt 156.
Referring now to FIG. 13, there is illustrated a top view of the collection docking station with the cassette 20 removed. The collection docking station has a flat plate 182 with sides 184 and 186 associated therewith, these providing a guide for the cassette 20 on either side thereof A door 184 is provided, which is substantially identical to the door 22 on the desktop docking station 16 in FIG. 2. This door 184 covers the key members 146 described above with respect to FIG. 10 and is operable to open in response to the cassette 20 being placed therein. The purpose of the door 184, as described above, is for protection and, also for a visual view to require the user to place the cassette above the door and then slide it down to open the door and insert the keys. Otherwise, the user might try to push down upon the keys 146, thus damaging the keys 146. A switch orifice 190 is provided for containing a switch 192, which switch 192 indicates the presence of the cassette 20 when the door 30 is opened. The door 30 is operable to open into a space 194 which has a plate 196 disposed on the upper end thereof. This plate 196 is raised and has two projections 198 and 200 which are operable to interface with the slots 114 and the door 30, as illustrated in FIG. 8. Therefore, the door 30 can be laid flat such that a flat surface is presented. The release lever device 150, described above with respect to FIG. 10, is disposed on the upper left side of the cassette 20 when disposed therein. An extending lever member 204 extends outward in front of the cassette 20 when installed and under the edge of the door 30, substantially under the pan head pin 98. Therefore, it is only necessary to actuate the lever 152 to raise the lever member 204 and pull the door 30 upward to allow the user to grasp this lever.
A sensor 206 is provided in the side of the buffer region 60 which is operable to sense the presence of notes on the surface of the paddle 68. The paddle 68 is reciprocated all the way up to the sorter such that it is past the sensor 206. The sensor will indicate that there are no notes past that point. Once the notes have been collected to a certain thickness, the paddle 68 will reciprocate past the sensor 206 and the sensor 206 will provide a signal to a central control system. The central control system will then determine if the switch 192 is depressed, indicating the presence of a cassette. If not, then the system will be shut down only when the paddle is not in the buffer region. If it is in the buffer region, it will continue to operate.
Referring now to FIG. 14, there is illustrated a top view of the closed end 72 of the cassette 20, illustrating the locking mechanism. A first shaft 210 extends between the left side 24 and right side 26 and has associated therewith on one side two pivoting lever members 212 and 214. On the opposite side, proximate to the right side 26, are disposed two similar pivoting lever members 216 and 218. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are separated by a plastic bushing 220 attached to the shaft 210 with springs 222 and 224 disposed between the block 220 and pivoting lever members 212 and 214, respectively. Similarly, a plastic block 226 is disposed between pivoting lever members 216 and 218 and separated therefrom by springs 228 and 230. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are disposed above the outside key access holes 74 on the left side of the end 72 and the two pivoting members 216 and 218 are each disposed against opposite ones of the outside holes on the key access hole 76. The key members 146 are comprised of two outside key members 231 and 232 and a central key member 236. The outside key members 231 and 232 of the key portion associated with the key access holes 74 are operable to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, on the key member 146 associated with the key access hole 76, the outer key members 231 and 232 are operable to pass through the outside key access holes 76 to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 216 and 218.
A second shaft 240 is provided that is disposed between the left side 24 and the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The shaft 240 is closer to the end 72. A pivoting lever 242 is disposed on the shaft 240 to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, a pivoting lever 244 is disposed on the shaft 240 and allowed to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever member 216 and 218. Disposed on each side of the pivoting members 242 are tracks (not shown}. These tracks are operable to receive pins 246 that extend outward from the associated pivoting members 212 and 214, or 216 and 218. This will be described in more in detail with respect to FIG. 15. The pivoting lever members 242 are urged upward with the center key members 236 in each of the key devices 146. As will be described hereinbelow, when the pivoting lever 242 is urged upward, it is necessary for the pivoting action of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214, and 216 and 216 to traverse the path such that the pins 246 disposed in the ends and extending outward therefrom will traverse a particular path. Therefore, there is a defined shape to each of the members 231 and 232 which will determine this path.
Referring now to FIG. 15, there is illustrated a side view of a locking member looking into the side of the right side 26. There is provided a locking lever 250, which is pivoted on one end at a pivot point 252 and has a "crook" 254 on the other end thereof, this crook being at a distance from the pivot point 252, such that the crook 252 will pivot into the path 70. Whenever the door 28 slides through the guide 70 into the crook 254, the locking lever 250 rotated such that the crook 254 is in that path, this will prevent further movement. Additionally, once the door 28 is urged against the crook 254, the direction of forces is "normal" to the pivot point 252, such that the lever 250 is not stressed, the force being along the length thereof.
The lever member 244 extends outward from the shaft 240 and has a pivoting shaft 256 disposed thereon, which is pivoted about a hole in the distal end of the locking lever 250, distal from the pivoting point 252. Whenever the lever 244 is urged upward by the locking pin 234, the pivoting shaft 256 will be urged upward, pivoting the locking lever 250 about the pivot point 252 and moving the crook 254 away from the path 70, to thereby allow the door 28 to pass thereby.
The pivoting lever 244 has a track 260 formed in the side thereof that is operable to interface with the pin 246 in the lever 216. An opposite path is disposed on the opposite side to interface with the pin 246 in the pivoting lever 218. This path 260 is configured such that, as lever 244 pivots upward, the end of the pivoting lever 216 must pivot in such a manner that the pin 246 will meander along the correct path. If the shape of the key member 231 is not correct, the path will be wrong and it will fall into defined "pockets" which will prevent further movement and further pivoting of lever 244. The shape of both key members 231 and 232 must be correct in order to insure that the end of the pivoting members 216 and 218 traverse the defined path.
In summary, there has been provided a currency sorting system utilizing a cassette for transporting the currency between locations. The cassette is a secured device that has an interior with a door that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the currency and an end that allows currency to be reciprocated out in a push operation. The cassette has a locking device for engaging with a corresponding key on a docking station, such that when the cassette is disposed on the docking station, the door will open. When removed from the docking station, and the door is closed, the door cannot be opened. The cassette is hand loaded at one docking station and then secured for movement to a second docking station that is associated with a sorting mechanism. On the sorting mechanism, it is necessary to feed the notes into the sorter input. The feeding docking station is approximately twice the length of the cassette with a cassette region and a buffer region. A paddle is utilized to extend downward into the cassette to urge the notes up into the buffer region. Once the notes are in the buffer region, the cassette can be removed and another cassette disposed therein and the paddle again moved into the cassette to urge the notes outward in a continuous motion. When the cassette is removed, it is then disposed in a third collection docking station in a collection slot. The collection slot is associated with a sorter output wherein notes that are sorted are disposed in particular ones of the collection docking stations. A paddle is provided in this station that reciprocates downward into the cassette as notes are disposed in that particular docking station. When the cassette is full, it can then be removed.
Although the preferred embodiment has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said buffer region has a length that is substantially equal to or greater than the length of the cassette.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the cassette has a top opening to expose the side of the stack of documents in the cassette and wherein said feeder mechanism is operable to place a flat paddle within the cassette adjacent the end of the stack of documents opposite to the open end of the cassette and urge the stack of documents outward into said buffer region.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the cassette has a locking mechanism for locking the operation of opening and wherein said docking station has associated therewith a key mechanism, which key mechanism is operable to interface with the locking mechanism of the cassette when the cassette is disposed in said docking station by the operation of disposing the cassette in said docking station.
5. A method for feeding documents from a plurality of portable cassettes to a receiving system, each of the cassettes containing a stack of documents, comprising the steps of:
transporting the cassettes to a docking station,
disposing one of the cassettes on a docking station with the stack of documents enclosed within a respective one of the cassettes in which it is loaded;
opening the one cassette to expose at least the end of the stack of documents disposed therein;
urging the stack of documents outward from the one cassette into a buffer region, while maintaining a substantially constant pressure on documents which are within the buffer region such that the receiving system is operable to continuously remove documents from the other end of the buffer region;
after urging the stack of documents outward from the one cassette, continuing to urge the stack of documents upward in the buffer region toward the receiving system and then removing the one cassette; and
disposing another of the cassettes in the docking station after removal of the previous one of the cassettes and repeating the operation of opening, urging and removing, such that a continuous supply of documents is maintained within the buffer region and able to continuously move through the buffer region during the steps of disposing, urging and removing.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the step of opening the one cassette is operable to expose the top of the one cassette and the side of the stack of documents.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the buffer region has a length approximately equal to or exceeding the length of the cassettes.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein each of the cassettes has a locking mechanism disposed thereon and the docking station has a key mechanism disposed thereon and, wherein the step of disposing the one cassette on the docking station is operable to interface the locking mechanism with the key mechanism and unlock the one cassette to allow the interior of the one cassette to be exposed to an operator in the step of opening, and the step of opening is inhibited when the one cassette is not in the docking station and the one cassette is in a locked configuration.

Guidelines November 2020 1 1. INTRODUCTION This appendix presents standards and guidelines for electrical design calculations for SPU projects. Design calculations establish minimum guidelines and requirements for generating electrical calculations on projects. Electrical calculations should be made for all SPU projects that include electrical components and should be filed in the project notebook. Design calculations may be made either manually or by SPU-approved computer programs. At a minimum, the following types of calculations should be made where applicable: • Load calculations • Conductor sizing • Conduit sizing • Motor branch circuit sizing • Power factor improvement • Transformer primary and secondary circuit sizing • Voltage drop • Motor starting voltage dip • Short circuit analysis • Lighting levels • Grounding in substations where step potentials are of concern • Harmonic distortion analysis • Cable pulling calculations • Generator capability/motor starting 2. SOFTWARE The electrical design engineer must use only SPU-approved electrical analysis software. The results should be validated with a hand calculation or order of magnitude estimate. Some SPUapproved software tools are: • SKM Power Tools for Windows (PTW) software. It includes a basic tool, DAPPER (load current, voltage drop, conductor sizing, etc) and several specialized tools such as HI_WAVE (harmonic analysis) and CAPTOR (circuit breaker coordination and settings) • Cummins Power Suite for sizing emergency generators • CenterONE available from Rockwell Automation for laying out motor control centers Spreadsheets may also be used to perform basic electrical load calculations with programs such as Microsoft EXCEL. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 2 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 3. CALCULATION MATRIX Project calculations serve as formal documentation of the project electrical design. They must contain sufficient description and detail to communicate the design concept, assumptions, and judgments associated with the design. Explanatory comments should be provided to assist reviewers and engineers who may use the calculations in the future. Table 9C-1 describes electrical calculation required for projects, tools to do the calculations, who is responsible for the calculations, and when they should be done.

BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRICAL CALCULATIONS The following are SPU basic requirements for electrical calculations: 1. Non-computer generated calculations must be on standard calculations sheets with the heading completely filled out. 2. Calculations generated by computer programs must conform with the following procedures: a. Include all heading information on each sheet b. Insert comments wherever possibly to clarify concepts and actions taken in the computer input c. Provide clear documentation of electrical geometry, support conditions, load application, and load requirements d. Where practical, provide sketch of model indicting nodes, materials, connectivity, etc. e. Provide electronic copy on CD or other suitable device of analysis input and output with hard copy calculations. f. Provide manual checks of pertinent results (e.g. service size, main feeder voltage drop) for computer generated output. 5. BASIC ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING FORMULAS This section describes basic electrical engineering formulas for creating design calculations. 5.1 LIST OF SYMBOLS V - Voltage (volts) I - Current (amps) R - Resistance (ohms) X - Reactance (ohms) Z - Impedance (ohms) W Real Power (watts) θ - Phase angle whose cosine is the power factor eff - Efficiency Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 5 5.2 DIRECT CURRENT (DC) FORMULAS Basic Formulas Volts V = I x R Power in watts P V I P I R = × = ×2 5.3 ALTERNATING CURRENT (AC) SINGLE PHASE V denotes line to neutral voltage. Basic Formulas Volts V = I × Z Power Factor pf = cosθ Apparent Power = Reactive Power = VA V x I VARS V x I x sinθ Real Power W = V x I x pf Phase Angle θ = arctan(W/VARS) Power Factor pf = W/(V x I) = W/VA Voltage Drop V ( ) d = 2 × I × R × cosθ + I × X × sinθ where: Vd = voltage drop in circuit sinθ = load reactive factor X = reactance 5.4 ALTERNATING CURRENT (AC), THREE-PHASE V denotes line to line voltage. Basic Formulas Apparent Power kVA = (V × I × 3) 2 2 kVA = kW + kVAR Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 6 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 Real Power kW = kVA× cosθ Reactive Power kVAR = kVA× sinθ Phase Angle θ =      arctan  kW kVAR Power Factor kVA kW pf = cosθ = Voltage Drop V ( ) d = 3 × I × R × cosθ + I × X × sinθ where: Vd = voltage drop in circuit sinθ = load reactive factor X = reactance 5.5 MOTORS 1 horsepower (hp) = 746 watts. Note: Motor hp rating relates to motor mechanical output. To determine motor input kVA requirements, the motor efficiency and power factor must be accounted for. In general, for preliminary or rough load calculations, assume: 1 kVA of electrical input power for 1 hp of motor. Example 9C-1 Motors Condition: A motor control center with a total connected horsepower of 337 hp can be assumed to require 337 kVA of input power. This is a conservative value, particularly for larger motors. Torque = (hp x 5250)/revolutions per minute (rpm) Fan hp = (cubic feet per minute [cfm] x pressure)/(33000 x eff) Pump hp = (gallons per minute [gpm] x head x specific gravity)/(3960 x eff) Motors (Single Phase) hp = (V x I x eff x pf)/746 Motors (3 phase) Synchronous Speed: ns = (120)(Frequency)/(# of Poles) ( ) 746 V I 3 eff pf hp × × × × = Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 7 5.6 POWER FACTOR CORRECTION The size of the capacitor needed to increase the power factor from pf1 to pf2 with the initial kVA given is: kVAR = kVA × − pf − pf pf − pf      1  1 2 1 2 1 2 2 / 6. SAMPLE CALCULATIONS This section presents sample calculations for electrical design. 6.1 LOAD Load calculations should be made using applicable sections of National Electrical Code (NEC) Articles 220, 430, and other sections of the NEC. The following load calculations should generally be used for sizing: • Feeder conductors and protective devices • Transformers • Panelboard and switchboard main busses • Motor control center components • Service entrance devices and conductors Load calculations must include all loads. They should be made by summing all of the loads (using appropriate diversity factors allowed by NEC Article 220) that are connected to each panelboard, switchboard, and motor control center. An allowance must be made for future load growth. The loads for each branch of the distribution system can then be summed back to the service entrance equipment. 6.2 GENERATOR SIZING The following information is intended to familiarize the design engineer with terms used by generator sizing software and underlying formulas. Generator single or multi-sets must be sized to supply maximum starting (SkVA), stead-state running (RkVA) and non-linear (GkW) demands of connected and future electrical equipment. Information critical to the sizing and selection of generator single or multi-sets include: • Environmental conditions: elevation, temperature, indoor or outdoor • Noise abatement requirements: mufflers, enclosure, silent models • Fuel: diesel, gasoline, natural gas • Fuel storage: skid mounted tank, day and remote tanks Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 8 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 • Cooling: liquid cooled radiator, forced air • Voltage regulation: maximum allowable voltage dips • Operation: prime, standby • Voltage ratings: voltage,3-phase, 1-phase, solid grounded, delta, wye • Connected loads: Linear, non-linear, power factor • Load operation: Motor starting methods, single step, single step with diversity, multiple steps of loading • Future loads 6.2.1 Sizing Procedures for Generator Single or Multi-sets The following is the sizing procedure for generator single or multi-sets: 1. Prepare a load schedule. 2. Enter individual load characteristics in software. 3. Enter loads in step sequence in software. 4. Have software calculate and select a generator set. It is a good practice to request a verifying calculation from the preferred genset manufacturer. 6.2.2 Definitions: Generator Sizing eff = Efficiency FLA = Full Load Amps GkW = Non-linear kW of connected load(s) LRA = Locked Rollor Amps Rpf = Running Power Factor of connected loads(s) RkVA = Running kVA of connected load(s) RkW = Running kW of connected load(s) Rpf = Running power factor of connected load(s) Rmsf= Reduced motor starting factor SkVA = Starting kVA of connected load(s) SkW = Starting kW of connected load(s) Spf = Starting power factor of connected load(s) 6.2.3 Underlying Equations 1.

Reduced Voltage Motor Starting: SkVA = SkVA× Rmsf Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 10 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 6.3 CONDUCTOR SIZE, GENERAL Conductor sizes must be determined in compliance with the specific NEC articles noted below, and with due consideration of other factors, such as terminal ratings and voltage drop as shown on Table 9C-2. Table 9C-2 NEC References for Conductor Sizing General Purpose Branch Circuits and Feeders Article 220 Service Entrance Conductors Article 230 Motor Circuits Article 430 Air Conditioning Equipment Article 440 Generators Article 445 Transformer (Primary and Secondary) Article 450 Capacitor Circuits Article 460 In this section, we will look at the general requirements for sizing conductors once the calculated load current is known. This is a two-step process: 1. The first step is to look at the temperature rating of the terminals and the ampacity of the conductor that could be used at a matching temperature rating. 2. The second step is to look at the effect of ambient temperature and conductor derating factors on the ampacity of the conductor that results from where and how the conductors are installed. Insulation used to cover electrical wiring conductors is rated for the maximum temperature it can withstand on a continuous basis. Standard ratings are 60°, 75°, 90°, and 105°C. The currentcarrying capability of a conductor is a function of: • Cross-section of the conductor • Insulation temperature rating • Ambient temperature The ampacity of a conductor of any size is increased as the rating of its insulation is increased. As the ambient temperature is increased, the ampacity of the conductor must be derated from its ampacity at 30°C. A No. 6 copper conductor with 90°C insulation will be rated for a higher continuous current than a No. 6 copper conductor with 60°C insulation. Because the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL) places certain restrictions on the size and temperature rating of conductor that can be used at its terminals, conductor size needs to be carefully determined. The UL tests for switchboards, panelboard, motor starters, and other equipment are made with wiring terminated on the equipment. The equipment is designed to take into account the heat transfer provided by these load-side conductors. If the conductor connected to a circuit breaker is smaller than the tested configuration, it will conduct less heat away from the circuit breaker. This will cause its thermal elements to operate at a lower temperature than with a larger Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 11 conductor, even though the smaller conductor may be adequate based on the NEC tables for wire size at its insulation rating. For this reason, the UL listing for circuit breakers, and many other types of equipment, is based on standard-size conductors. These standard sizes, in turn, are based on the NEC ampacity for a particular insulation temperature rating. UL uses the following basic rule for circuit breakers: • Circuit breakers through 125A: Use 60°C insulation ampacity • Circuits breakers 150A and above: Use 75°C insulation ampacity Higher rated insulations may be used, but the conductors must be sized based on the lower rated insulation. Of course, these are minimums, and larger wire may be used. Although this is the basic rule, there are exceptions. Equipment where all terminations are rated for use with 75°C wire has become widely available, and this is what we typically ask for in our specifications for all electrical equipment down through 120V panelboards. However, this is not universal, and we must make sure that our wiring is sized appropriately. If you size all smaller circuits (through 125A) based on 60°C wire, you will stay out of trouble. Paragraphs 210-19 and 215-2 of the NEC require that branch circuit and feeder conductors have an ampacity not less than the load to be served. NEC Paragraph 210-22 contains additional information relative to branch circuit loads. Once branch circuit and feeder loads have been determined using applicable sections of NEC Article 230 and other applicable articles, conductor sizes should then be determined using Tables 310-16 through 310-31 of the NEC. The four examples presented below are based on the ampacities presented in NEC Table 310-16, as modified by the applicable correction factors for temperature and conduit fill. Example 9C-2 Conductor Size No. 1 Conditions: Continuous load rated 43A served by a conduit containing only the conductors for the load, running through a wet area that could have an ambient temperature as high as 42°C. Conductors are to be copper with type THHN/THWN insulation. Required ampacity per NEC paragraphs 210-16 and 210-22: • Ampacity required = continuous load x 125% or 53.75 amps A No. 6 AWG copper conductor having an ampacity of 55 amps (with 60°C insulation) would be the correct choice at the terminals of the circuit breaker serving the load. Note, however, that NEC Table 310-16 applies only up to a maximum ambient temperature of 30°C. Where the ambient temperature exceeds the 30°C ambient temperature on which Table 310-16 is based, the allowable ampacity of the conductor must be corrected using the correction factors at the bottom of Table 310-16, as required by NEC paragraph 310-10. • Ampacity of No. 6 conductor (THHN/THWN wet, 75°C column) = 65 amps • Corrected ampacity = 65 x correction factor (.82) = 65 x .82 = 53.3 amps Because 53.75 amps is required, this conductor is not adequate. The next larger size conductor will need to be used even though its ampacity was sufficient at the circuit breaker. If the circuit were being installed where the conductors would never be wet or where conductors with insulation suitable for wet application at 90°C were being used, the 90°C Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 12 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 column ampacity of the conductor could be used for determining the corrected ampacity of the conductor in the conduit. • Ampacity of No. 6 conductor (THHN/THWN DRY, or THWN-2 or XHHW-2 wet, 90°C column) = 75 amps • Corrected ampacity = 75 x correction factor (.87) = 75 x .87 = 65.2 amps The No. 6 conductor would be adequate for this installation and could be protected by a 60-amp circuit breaker even though its 60°C rating is only 55 amps. The 60-amp circuit breaker would be allowed by paragraph 240-3, which allows a conductor to be protected by the next larger size overcurrent device if the size of the device is 800 amps or less. Example 9C-3 Conductor Size No. 2 Conditions: The same load and ambient conditions as above, but with 6-phase conductors in the same conduit. We already know that the No. 6 conductors are adequate at the terminals and that they would not be adequate if the circuit were wet—unless the conductor insulation were rated 90°C, wet. Assume the conductors to be No. 6 THWN-2 insulation. • Corrected ampacity = 75 x correction factor (.87) = 75 x .87 = 65.2 amps • (Ampacity from 90°C column, corrected for temperature) Where more than three current-carrying conductors are contained in the same raceway, the ampacity of the conductors must also be derated by the ampacity adjustment factor contained in Note 8 of NEC Tables 310-16 through 310-19. • Corrected ampacity of six No. 6 conductors = 65.2 x .8 = 52.2 amps Because 53.75 amps is required, this conductor is not adequate and the next larger size conductor will need to be used, even though its ampacity was sufficient at the circuit breaker. If the ambient temperature were reduced to below 40°C, the temperature correction factor would be increased to .91, resulting in an increase in the conductor ampacity. • Corrected ampacity = 75 x .91 (temp. correction) x .8 (six conductors) = 54.6 amps Again, the No. 6 THWN-2 conductor would be adequate for this installation and could be protected by a 60-amp circuit breaker even though its 60°C rating is only 55 amps. Example 9C-4 Conductor Size No. 3 Conditions: A feeder with 200A of noncontinuous load and 65A of continuous load to be installed in conduit in a wet area with an ambient temperature of 30°C or less. • Required ampacity per NEC paragraph 220-10 = noncontinuous load + 1.25 x continuous load • Or 200 + 1.25 x 65 = 281.25 amps The feeder overcurrent device would be sized at 300A because that is the next larger standard rating (see Article 240 of the NEC). Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 13 The conductor ampacity requirement can be met by either one 300-kCM conductor or two 1/0 conductors with THHN/THWN or XHHW insulation per phase. Example 9C-5 Conductor Size No. 3 Conditions: The same load as used in example No. 3, but the conduit is to be installed in a dry area with an ambient temperature of 38°C. • Required ampacity calculated above = 281.25 amps. • Ampacity of one 300-kCM THHN/THWN or XHHW conductor is 320 amps in a dry location. • Correction factor for 90°C conductors in a 38°C ambient temperature = 0.91. • Corrected ampacity = 320 amps x 0.91 = 291. If the conductors were being installed in a wet location, the ampacity from the 75°C column would have to be used (refer to Table 310-13 for operating temperature), and the results would be different—unless conductors with insulation rated 90°C, wet, such as THWN-2 or XHHW-2, are used. Note that, at the terminals, the ampacity of the conductors must be based on the temperature rating of the terminals (either 60°C or 75°C); therefore, if the terminals are in a high-ambient-temperature area, this procedure must be modified. 6.4 CONDUIT SIZE AND FILL Where conductors are installed in conduit, the conduit should be sized in accordance with Tables 1 through 5A in Chapter 9 and Appendix C of the NEC, and all associated notes. Following are two examples of how conduits can be sized under different circumstances. Example 9C-6 Conduit Size and Fill No. 1 Conditions: Three 4/0 AWG conductors with XHHW insulation installed in rigid steel conduit (no separate ground conductor). See NEC Table C8 for conduit size required for three 4/0 AWG conductors with XHHW insulation. The table would allow only two conductors to be installed in a 1-1/2-inch conduit and four to be installed in a 2-inch conduit; therefore, a 2-inch conduit is the correct choice. Example 9C-7 Conduit Size and Fill No. 2 Conditions: Three No. 4/0 phase conductors, one No. 1/0 neutral and one No. 2 equipment ground conductor to be installed in rigid metal conduit. Phase and neutral conductor insulation will be XHHW and the ground conductor will have TW insulation. Because the tables in Appendix C of NEC are for situations where all conductors in a conduit are the same size, they cannot be used for this example. NEC Table 4, using appropriate conductor areas from NEC Table 5, must then be used. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 14 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 Table 9C-3 Total conductor area Conductor size Area 4/0 XHHW 0.3197 1/0 XHHW 0.1825 # 2 TW 0.1333 Total Area = 3(.3197) + .1825 + .1333 = 1.275 square inches Conduit size required: Because more than two conductors that are not lead covered are being installed, the column for 40 % fill in NEC Table 4 can be used. Select conduit with a usable area greater than 1.275 square inches; therefore, conduit size = 2 inch (40% of total area = 1.363 square inches). Caution: Both Schedule 40 and Schedule 80 PVC have a smaller inside diameter than rigid metal conduit and thus will have a smaller total area. EMT also has a smaller inside diameter in the smaller sizes (2-inch and less). Conduits must be based on the conduit type having the smallest inside diameter allowed by the specifications for a project. Schedule 40 PVC has a smaller diameter than all other types of conduit, except Schedule 80 PVC, and its area could be used as a default value for most calculations. 6.5 MOTOR BRANCH CIRCUIT NEC Article 430, Motors, Motor Circuits, and Controllers, covers the provisions for motors, motor circuits, and controllers. NEC Article 430 includes tables for motor full-load currents, which are the minimum values that can be used in determining sizes of motor branch circuits, motor feeders, short circuit and overcurrent device sizes and settings, and miscellaneous load calculations. Actual nameplate currents must be used if they are larger than the minimum values provided in the tables. The values in the tables should be increased for induction motors with full-load speeds of less than 1,200 rpm and for motors powered by solid-state drives. In addition, a table is provided for determining the maximum rating or setting of motor branch circuit, short circuit, and ground fault protective devices. NEC Article 440 contains special provisions that apply to the installation of air conditioning and refrigeration equipment and should be referred to for these applications. The following calculations and the accompanying table are based on the applicable provisions of NEC Article 430 and are provided as a guide for performing motor branch circuit and feeder calculations and for sizing components for motor branch circuits as part of a design. The typical calculations required are demonstrated by the following examples. Example 9C-8 Motor Branch Circuit No. 1 Conditions: Induction motor is rated 60 hp, 460V, 3-phase, Code letter G, 1,800 rpm continuous, and will be powered by a combination motor starter through a conduit system. All equipment and the conduit system are located in areas with ambient temperatures of 30°C or less. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 15 In NEC Table 430-150, the minimum motor full-load current that must be used for a 60-hp motor in the calculations is 77 amps. Using this value, the motor branch circuit and ground fault protection device, the branch circuit conductors, and the motor disconnecting means can be sized. Motor branch circuit and ground fault protection devices are to be sized as outlined in Part IV of NEC Article 430, with maximum settings as provided in NEC Table 430-52. Actual settings should reflect the recommendation of the manufacturer of the motor control equipment that will be provided. For example, Table 9C-4 shows General Electric's recommendations. Table 9C-4 General Electric’s Recommendations Device Type Rating 430-52 Maximum Ratings Magnetic-only circuit breaker 100 amps 700% Thermal magnetic breaker 125 amps 250% Time delay fuses 90 amps 175% Branch circuit conductors must be sized in accordance with the requirements of Part B of NEC Article 430. NEC paragraph 430-22 requires that conductors supplying a motor must have an ampacity not less than 125% of the full-load current of the motor. A special exception is made for motors that are operated intermittently for short periods. Motor branch circuit ampacity must be equal to or greater than: • 77 amps x 1.25 = 96.25 amps Conductor size is to be No. 1 AWG copper with XHHW insulation No. 1 AWG = 110 amps at 60°C. Note: 60°C ampacity rating of conductors No. 1 AWG and smaller must be used unless the engineer is sure that all terminals are rated for use at 75°C. See the UL General Information Directory for more details on this subject. Motor disconnecting means must be sized in accordance with the requirements of Part H of NEC Article 430. The disconnecting means for motor circuits rated 600V, nominal, or less, must have an ampere rating of at least 115% of the full-load current rating of the motor. Motor disconnecting means must be sized greater than: • 77 amps x 1.15 = 88.5 Disconnect is to be rated 100 amps. See Table 9-15 in DSG Chapter 9, Electrical Design, for the conduit and conductor requirements for motors typically found in SPU design projects. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 16 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 Example 9C-9 Motor Branch Circuit No. 2 Conditions: Determine the size of the feeder conductors and thermal magnetic circuit breaker feeding a motor control center that has a total connected motor load of 215A, with the 60-hp motor from Example 1 being the largest motor. In addition, there are 45A of continuous load and 65A of noncontinuous load. Conductors should be copper with type XHHW insulation installed in an area where the ambient temperature is less than 30°C. Motor feeder conductors must be sized in accordance with applicable portions of Part B of NEC Article 430, and feeder breakers must be sized in accordance with applicable portions of Part E of NEC Article 430. NEC paragraph 430-24 requires that the conductors supplying the motor control center have an ampacity sufficient for the motor load determined in accordance with NEC paragraph 430-24, plus the nonmotor load that would be determined in accordance with NEC Article 220. NEC paragraph 430-24 requires that the motor load used in this determination be equal to the sum of the full-load currents of all the motors in the group plus 25% of the highest rated motor. The required ampacity of the conductors should be calculated as follows: • Total motor load + 25% of largest motor FLA + noncontinuous load + 125% of continuous load or • 215 + (.25 x 77) + 65 + (1.25 x 45) = 355 amps Conductors may be either one 500 kCM or two No. 3/0 AWG per phase (one 500 kCM = 380 amps, two No. 3/0 = 400 amps). NEC paragraphs 430-62 (a) and (b) cover the requirements for sizing the motor feeder short circuit and ground fault protection. Paragraph (a) covers the requirements for situations where spare capacity for future additions is not wanted or required. Paragraph (b) covers situations where spare capacity is to be provided and allows the feeder protective device size or setting to be based on the ampacity of the feeder circuit conductors. For the above example, a 400-amp device would be selected. For the 400-amp device to be used to protect the 500-kCM conductors, NEC paragraph 240-3(b) needs to be used. 6.6 POWER FACTOR CORRECTION CAPACITORS Power factor correction capacitors are installed for either of the following reasons: • To increase the measured power factor at the serving utility’s meter and reduce the power factor penalty being imposed by the utility. Power factor correction for this reason cannot be justified unless the serving utility actually has a power factor penalty in its rate schedule. • To release additional capacity in feeder conductors. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 17 For example, a 3-phase load of 200 kW would be equal to 301A at 480V if the power factor were 80%, but it would be only 254A if the power factor were raised to 95%. This would release 47A of capacity for additional loads. Article 460 of the NEC covers the installation of capacitors on electric circuits. Those calculations needed to determine the size of the capacitor required and the size of conductors required to connect the capacitors to their electric power supply are discussed in this section. Following are several examples to illustrate the required calculations: Example 9C-10 Power Factor No. 1 Conditions: A load of 200 kVA exists at 480V with a power factor of 80%. Determine the amount of capacitors required to improve the power factor to 95%. Power factor = Apparent power (kVA) ÷ Real power (kW) By definition, the power factor is the cosine of the angle that exists between the real power and apparent power vectors. The calculation to determine the amount of capacitance (measured in kVAR) should be made as follows: kVAR at initial power factor = �(kVA)2 – (kW)2 ) = �(kVA)2 – (kVA X pf)2 kVAR = �(200kVA)2 – (160kw)2 kVAR = �40,000 – 25,600 = 120.0 kVAR Because the real power of a load is not changed when the power factor is improved, we can use the known real power and desired power factor to calculate the new kVAR value in the vector triangle: kVAR @ 95% power factor = �(kW ÷ pf)2 – (kW)2 kVAR = �(160 ÷ .95)2 – (160)2 kVAR = �(28,366 – 25,600) = 52.6 Required kVAR for correction = 120 - 52.6 = 67.4 kVAR Similar calculations can be made to determine the size of the capacitor required to improve the power factor of a single motor to a higher power factor. Tables are available from capacitor manufacturers to simplify the selection of these capacitors. Capacitors larger than the maximum size recommended by motor manufacturers must not be installed in order to avoid overexcitation of motor at no-load condition. Example 9C-11 Power Factor Correction Capacitor No. 2 Conditions: Load is a 60-hp, 1,800-rpm motor operating at 480V, 3-phase. Capacitors rated 15 kVAR at 480V are being installed to improve the power factor. Determine the size of the conductor needed to meet the requirements of the NEC. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 18 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 NEC paragraph 460-8 contains two criteria that must be met when sizing branch circuit conductors to capacitors. First, the ampacity of the conductors must be at least 135% of the rated current of the capacitors. Second, if the capacitors are connected to a motor circuit, the conductors to the capacitor should have an ampacity not less than one-third of the ampacity of the motor branch circuit conductors. Capacitor rated amps = 15 ÷ (.48× 3) =18 Branch circuit amps = 18 x 1.35 = 24.4 minimum Motor branch circuit amps = 1.25 x 77 = 96.25 Based on the above calculations, you need to use the following: No. 1 AWG at 110 amps (60°C ampacity) for motor branch circuit Capacitor branch circuit amps as 1/3 of motor branch circuit ampacity = 110/3 = 36.7 amps Therefore, the branch circuit conductors to the capacitor must have an ampacity of 37 amps or greater. Refer to Industrial Power Systems Handbook by Beeman or Electrical Systems Analysis and Design for Industrial Plants by Lazar for additional formulas related to the application of capacitors on electrical systems. 6.7 TRANSFORMER PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CONDUCTORS Article 450 of the NEC, Transformers and Transformer Vaults, covers the installation of all transformers. Article 450 deals with transformers over 600V nominal and transformers 600V, nominal, and less. The calculations most often made during an electrical system design are for a transformer 600V, nominal, or less with both primary and secondary protection. The following calculations and Table 9-14 in DSG Chapter 9, Electrical Design are based on the provisions of NEC paragraph 450-3(b)(2). Primary conductors and feeder overcurrent and ground fault protection devices (feeder breakers) may be sized up to 250% of rated transformer primary current, but the values shown in the table are sized for the next larger device above 150% of the transformer full-load amps to minimize the possibility of the feeder breaker tripping on transformer inrush. The secondary conductors and secondary breaker are sized at the standard rating that is nearest to 125% of the calculated secondary full load current. The exception at the end of NEC paragraph 450-3(b)(2) allows moving up to the next higher standard rating. Following are two examples to show the calculations that are required for 3-phase and 1- phase transformers. Example 9C-12 Transformer Primary and Secondary Conductors No. 1 Conditions: Assume a 45-kVA, 3-phase transformer with a 480-V primary and a 208/120-V secondary. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 19 Calculate primary full-load amps: 45 kVA ÷ ((480 volts x 1.73) ÷1000) = 54.2 amps Calculate required feeder breaker and conductor ampacity: 54.2 amps x 1.5 = 81 amps Use a 90-amp breaker and No. 3 AWG copper conductors Calculate secondary full-load amps: 45 kVA ÷ ((208 volts x 1.73) ÷ 1000) = 125.06 amps Calculate required secondary breaker size and conductor ampacity at 125% secondary full-load amps: 125.06 amps x 1.25 = 156.3 amps Use a 150-amp breaker and No. 1/0 copper conductors1 Note: This selection limits the continuous load that can be supplied by the transformer to 43.2 kVA ((80% x 208 volts x 150 amps x 1.73) ÷ 1000). The ground conductors for the above circuits must be sized in accordance with NEC Tables 250 94 and 250-95. The ground conductor in the feeder to the primary should be sized as an equipment ground in accordance with NEC Table 250-95. The grounding electrode conductor on the secondary of the transformer must be sized as required by NEC paragraph 250-26 using Table 250-94. Example 9C-13 Transformer Primary and Secondary Conductors No. 2 Conditions: Assume a 25-kVA 1-phase transformer with a 480-V primary and a 120/240-V secondary. Calculate primary full-load amps: 25 kVA ÷ (480 volts ÷ 1000) = 52.1 amps Calculate required feeder breaker size and conductor ampacity: 52.1 amps x 1.5 = 78.1 amps Use an 80-amp breaker and No. 3 AWG copper conductors. 1 Calculate secondary full-load amps: 25 kVA ÷ (240 volts ÷ 1000) = 104.2 amps Calculate required secondary breaker size and conductor ampacity: 104.2 amps x 1.25 = 130 amps Use a 150-amp breaker and No. 1/0 AWG copper conductors.1 1 Conductor sizes for these examples are based on the use of 60°C wire for size 14 through 1 AWG and 75° C wire for size 1/0 and above. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 20 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 Example 9C-14 Transformer Primary and Secondary Conductors No. 3 Condition: Assume a 1500-kVA transformer with a primary over 600V and a 480-V, 3-phase secondary. Calculate secondary full-load amps: 1500 kVA / ((480/1000) X 1.73) = 1804 Calculate required feeder breaker size and conductor ampacity (circuit breaker size based on criteria of Table 450-3(a)(1)) : 1804 X 1.25 = 2255 amps The size of the circuit breaker and its trip setting will vary, depending on the type of circuit breaker being installed. If a conventional, molded case circuit breaker without solid state trip units were being installed, a 2500-amp breaker could be installed because of exception No. 1. It would be the next higher standard rating per Article 240-6(a). Circuit breakers that have solid state trip elements with replaceable rating plugs and front-ofbreaker adjustments must be set so that the adjustable setting is the next possible value higher than the calculated value using the circuit breaker installed. Depending on the frame rating of the breaker and the rating plug installed, the resulting trip settings will vary. For example, a 4000-amp breaker with a 2500-amp rating plug would be acceptable. If a Square D 3000 amp frame breaker were installed, a setting of 0.8 would result in a trip setting of 2400 amps. A similar trip setting could be achieved with a GE 3200 amp power circuit breaker and a 2400 amp rating plug at 1.0. It is important to note that the trip setting of an adjustable breaker may not be the same as the standard ratings listed in 240-6(a). The conductor will need to be protected by the circuit breaker and installed as required by Article 240-3. Assuming that a 2400-amp trip setting is selected, feeder conductors could be seven 500 kCM, six 600 kCM, or five 750 kCM per phase. 6.8 VOLTAGE DROP 6.8.1 Feeder and Branch Circuits Fine-print note No. 4 to NEC paragraph 210-19 states that branch circuit conductors should be sized so that voltage drop on the branch circuit does not exceed 3%. Furthermore, it states that the total voltage drop on feeder conductors plus branch circuit conductors should not exceed 5%. Fine-print note No. 2 to NEC paragraph 215-2(b) would allow the voltage drop on a feeder to be 3% as long as the total voltage drop to the load is 5% or less. Voltage drops are caused by current flowing through an impedance. To calculate steady-state voltage drop, the circuit impedance, circuit current, and power factor of that current relative to some voltage must be known. Rigorous methods of calculating voltage drop can be very involved and complicated; for purposes of ordinary use in designing power circuits for industrial Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 21 projects, approximate methods are generally satisfactory. IEEE Standard 141-1986 (Red Book) gives the approximate formula for voltage drop as: Vd = IR cosθ + IX sin θ where: Vd = voltage drop in circuit, line to neutral I = current flowing in conductor R = line resistance for one conductor in ohms X = line reactance for one conductor in ohms θ= angle whose cosine is the load power factor cosθ = load real power factor sin θ= load reactive power factor The voltage drop calculated using this formula must be multiplied by 2 for 1-phase circuits and 1.73 for 3-phase circuits. Calculations using the above formula are not required for most designs because the results obtained using published tables give satisfactory results. The following calculations were made using Table 13 on page 99 of IEEE Std 141-1986 (Red Book) and the accompanying procedure for making the calculations. Similar results can be obtained using published tables and graphs available in other reference books, manufacturer's catalogs, and computer programs such as DAPPER. Example 9C-15 Feeder and Branch Circuits Condition: No. 1 AWG copper conductors feeding a motor rated 60 hp (77A full-load), 3-phase, 460V through rigid metal conduit with a circuit length of 520 feet. Assume that the motor power factor is 85%. Calculate voltage drop on a 3-phase circuit from Table 13 of Red Book. The factor for No. 1 AWG copper conductors in magnetic conduit at 85% power factor (pf) = 2.55 (need to interpolate between .7 and .8 pf) Voltage drop = ((520 feet x 77 amps) ÷ 10000) x 2.55 volts = 10.2 volts Calculate percent voltage drop by dividing the calculated volts dropped by the system voltage and then multiplying by 100: (10.2 Vac ÷ 480 volts) x 100 = 2.13% drop Factors are provided at the bottom of Table 13 of the Red Book and are to be used to convert the calculated voltage drop to 1-phase line-to-line and 1-phase line-to-neutral values. 6.8.2 Motor Starting The calculations required to determine the voltage drop on an electrical system because of motor starting are too complex to be covered in this design guide. The IEEE Std 399-1990 (Red Book), Industrial Power Systems Handbook by Beeman, and Electrical Systems Analysis and Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 22 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 Design for Industrial Plants by Lazar both have very complete sections on this subject. These calculations are often done as part of a short circuit analysis using a computer, because they are very complex and are based on much of the same information required to do the short circuit analysis. These calculations should be made based on the largest motor at each load center to determine if the voltage drop on motor starting is of such magnitude that it will cause adverse impacts on other equipment in the system. For instance, a 20% voltage dip could cause control relays to drop out, since many of these are designed to operate only at voltage levels 15% below rated voltage. 6.9 SHORT CIRCUIT The proper selection of protective devices and coordination of their trip settings is based on short circuit calculations. The calculations required to complete a detailed short circuit analysis are very complex and beyond the scope of this design guide. The Industrial Power Systems Handbook by Beeman, Electrical Systems Analysis and Design for Industrial Plants by Lazar, the IEEE Std 399-1990, and many other references contain detailed procedures for performing short circuit analysis. In those situations where an approximate value of short circuit current is needed for preliminary design purposes, the following abbreviated method can be used to estimate a very conservative value of maximum fault current. This result will exceed the actual fault current, since many small impedances are neglected to simplify the calculations. In every situation where this method is used, a detailed calculation, either made by hand or using an approved computer program, should be made during final design. Calculations to determine an approximate value of symmetrical short circuit current in a power distribution system are shown in the following example. Example 9C-16 Short Circuit Conditions: The load will be served by a 1,500-kVA transformer at 480V 3-phase through a single motor control center. The fault current available from the utility on the source side of the transformer is unknown, the transformer impedance is assumed to be 5.75% (based on published data), and the motor load on the transformer is approximately 75% of the rating of the transformer. Note that the standard transformer impedance is valued at +/- 7.5% of nominal. Therefore for a conservative calculation the lowest impedance should be used: 5.75% x ((100%-7.5%) ÷100) = 5.32% The current flowing during a fault at any point in an electrical system is limited by the impedance of the circuits and equipment from the source or sources to the point where the fault has occurred. For these simplified calculations, we will assume that the only sources are the transformer and the motors connected to the system. The motors are connected in parallel with the transformer as an impedance with an infinite bus as the source of the fault current. The basic formula used to calculate short circuit currents is: Short circuit current = Driving Voltage/ Total Impedance (Ohm's law) Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 23 A point-to-point calculation of short circuit current available at any point can be made using this formula. It is the basic formula used in the per-unit method to calculate short circuit current values in electric power circuits. The reactance of the utility system must be assumed zero, and the following simplification can be made to determine short circuit current let through by a transformer: Approximate transformer per-unit Z = (%Z)(base kVA) ÷ ((100) (transformer kVA)) If we let base kVA = transformer kVA, then: per-unit Z of the transformer = %Z / 100 The basic formula for calculating short circuit current when the per-unit method is used is: I s.c. rms sym = base kVA ÷ (1.73 x kV x (per-unit Z of the transformer) Because we have let base kVA = transformer kVA and transformer kVA ÷ (1.73 x kV) = transformer load current for three phase transformers, we can simplify the above formula to: I s.c. rms sym = transformer FLA ÷ (%Z ÷ 100) transformer FLA = 1,500 kVA ÷ (.48 x 1.73) or FLA = 1,806.4 amps The resulting short circuit current let through by the transformer in our example would be: I s.c.rms sym = 1806.4 ÷ (5.32 ÷ 100) or I s.c. rms sym = 33,955 amps The motor contribution to a fault by a single or group of low-voltage induction motors can be taken as approximately five times the motor full-load current. This is because the reactance of a low-voltage induction motor, including the leads, is approximately 20%. A point-to-point calculation made as above for a transformer would result in a multiplier of 5. Motor load of 75% of transformer rating was given; therefore, motor FLA would be 1,806 x .75 = 1,355 amps. I s.c. rms sym = 1,355 x 5 = 6775 amps The total short circuit current available at the point of the fault would be the total of the contribution from the transformer plus the contribution for the motor load or total Is.c. rms sym = 33,955 + 6775 or 40,730 amps rms sym Because neither the serving utility’s source impedance nor the impedances of the interconnecting conductors and equipment are included in this calculation, this value can be very conservative and must be used carefully. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 24 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 6.10 LIGHTING Lighting calculations shall be made using the recommended procedures established by the Illuminating Engineering Society and outlined in the IES Lighting Handbook. Two methods are available for calculating the lighting levels in a space: the lumen or zonal cavity method and the point-by-point method. The zonal cavity method is used to calculate the average foot-candle level within the space, and the point-by-point method is used to predict the illumination for a specific visual task. The following examples are provided to demonstrate these two calculation methods. Example 9C-17 Lighting No 1: Lumen or Zonal Cavity Method Conditions: Design a lighting system for a room 15 feet x 25 feet, with an 11-foot ceiling that will be used for general office work. The ceiling will be lay-in ceiling tile and the walls will be painted off-white. The luminaires will be cleaned regularly and lamps will be group-replaced when the first failures start to occur. Basic equations: Footcandles Total Lumens Striking Area Area = Area lamps lumens lamp CU LLF Footcandles × × × = ( / ) where: CU = coefficient of utilization LLF = light loss factor LLF is made up of a number of factors. The ones to be included in most calculations are lamp lumen depreciation (LLD), luminaire dirt depreciation (LDD), and room surface depreciation (RSD). The CU of a luminaire is calculated by the zonal cavity method and is a measure of how a specific luminaire distributes light into a given room. The CU takes into account luminaire efficiency, candle-power distribution of the luminaire, room size and shape, mounting height, and surface reflectances. The CU for a specific luminaire must be obtained from the manufacturer's catalog. To determine the CU for a specific application, several values must be determined: • Effective floor cavity reflectance • Effective ceiling cavity reflectance • Wall reflectance • Room cavity ratio (RCR) Most CU tables are based on a floor cavity ratio (PFC) of 20, so that figure will be used for this example. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 25 If the suspension length of the luminaire below the ceiling is zero, which it is for this example, the ceiling cavity ratio (PCC) is equal to the ceiling reflectance. If the luminaire is suspended, a ceiling cavity ratio must be calculated before the effective ceiling cavity reflectance can be determined. Reflectance values for various surfaces are available in the IES Lighting Handbook. For this example, 70% will be used. The wall reflectance (PW) of materials can be obtained from the IES Lighting Handbook. For this example, 70% will be used. The RCR must be calculated; it is equal to 2.5 times the area of the walls divided by the area of the work plane (Table 9C-5): Table 9C-5 Coefficient of Utilization Zonal Cavity Method 4-Lamp PFC 20 PCC 80 70 50 PW 70 50 30 70 50 30 50 30 RCR CU (divide table values by 100) 0 76 76 76 74 74 74 70 70 1 70 68 66 69 66 64 64 62 2 65 61 57 64 60 56 58 55 3 60 55 50 59 54 50 52 49 4 56 49 45 55 49 44 47 43 5 51 44 39 50 44 39 42 38 6 48 40 35 46 39 35 38 34 7 44 36 31 43 36 31 35 30 8 40 32 27 40 32 27 31 27 9 37 29 24 36 29 24 28 24 10 35 26 21 34 26 21 25 21 Notes Test No. 7834 S/MH = 1.3. For 2-lamp: multiply above CUs by 1.16. For 3-lamp: multiply above CUs by 1.09. The work plane height is the level at which most tasks will be performed and is assumed to be 30 inches for this example. RCR = (2.5)(11−2.5)�2 (15+25)� (15)(25) = 4.53 From the CU table above (see bold numbers), the resultant CU must be interpolated between 0.55 and 0.50. The resultant CU = 0.523. Before the calculation to determine the number of lamps required can be performed, several decisions must still be made: • Type of lamp to be used; this affects lumens per lamp. Assume 3150. • Lamps per luminaire; this affects the CU, which was calculated. For this calculation, assume four, which is the basis of the CU table. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 26 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 • LLD must be determined. • LDD must be determined. • RSD must be determined. • Foot-candle level desired must be determined. Values for LLD, LDD, RSD, and a number of other factors that cause light loss in the space can be found in the IES Lighting Handbook. For most calculations dealing with lighting in noncritical areas, however, all of these factors can be combined into a single factor, which is often referred to as the light loss factor (LLF). For this calculation, an LLF of 0.75 has been assumed. Footcandle levels are recommended for a number of applications in the IES Lighting Handbook. The recommended level for general office work falls between 50 and 150 foot-candles, depending on the level of difficulty of the task. For this calculation, the level required is assumed to be 100 foot-candles. Put all of the numbers into a basic equation and solve it for the number of lamps required: 15 x 25 No.of lamps 3150 0.523 0.75 100 = × × × No. of lamps = 30.4 or @4 lamps/fixture = 7.6 fixtures The next task is to lay out the luminaires in the room to determine if they will fit in a logical arrangement. Because the luminaires are being installed in a lay-in ceiling, spacing can only be in multiples of 2 feet. For this example, installation of eight luminaires would require two rows of four luminaires each. Spacing across room = 15 ÷ 2 or about 8 feet Between rows and (15-8) ÷ 2 or 3.5 feet between wall and closest luminaire (all dimensions are to centerline) Spacing length of room = 25 ÷ 4 or 6 feet Between luminaires in the row and (25 - (3 x 6)) ÷ 2 or 3.5 feet from the wall to the end luminaires The foot-candle level that results from the number of luminaires to be installed should then be checked: Footcandles = (8 4) 3150 0.523 35 15 25 = 105.4 footcandles × × × × × The maximum spacing of the luminaires must also be checked against the mounting height above the work plane (S/MH ratio) to determine if it is within the ratio of the luminaire being used. 8 ft spacing ÷ 8.5 ft mounting height = 0.94 This is well within the 1.3 S/MH ratio of the luminaire used in the example. If the luminaires required will not fit the layout, or the foot-candle levels from the layout are not acceptable, or the S/MH ratio calculated is not less than that of the luminaire used, then revise the layout using a luminaire with a different number of lamps or different characteristics. Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 27 The foot-candle level calculated tells us the quantity of light that reaches the work surface. Other factors that affect visual comfort and ability to see include direct glare, indirect glare, reflected glare, and ceiling reflections. In areas where seeing tasks are critical, these must also be evaluated. See the IES Lighting Handbook and other lighting design and application guides for additional information on these subjects. Example 9C-18 Lighting No 2: Point by Point Calculation Conditions: Referring to the luminaire layout for example No. 1, calculate the foot-candle level on a desk located at point No. 1. For this calculation, use the candlepower distribution table below and assume that no light is reflected from the end wall (Table 9C-6). Table 9C-6 Candlepower Distribution Curve 4-Lamp Angle End 45° Cross 0 3429 3429 3429 5 3396 3401 3460 15 3293 3328 3401 25 3061 3133 3245 35 2649 2814 2906 45 1982 2051 2188 55 1229 1110 1247 65 681 425 662 75 314 218 306 85 94 90 78 Point-to-point calculations are typically used to determine the foot-candle level, either horizontal or vertical, on a specific task location from a point source or multiple point sources of light. Illumination on the task is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of illumination. Basic equations: Foot-candles (horizontal plane) Fc h candlepower ( ) cos = × θ distance2 Fc v candlepower ( ) sin = × θ distance2 Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 28 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 Foot-candles (vertical plane) where: Candlepower (CP) is the candlepower of the source in the direction of the ray Cos q = height above task (H) ÷ actual distance from task (D) Sin q = horizontal distance from task (R) ÷ D Using the above data, calculate the vertical foot-candles on the work surface 4 feet horizontal from the luminaire: D = (H + R ) = (8.5 + 4 ) = 9.4 2 2 2 2 cos . . . arccos . ) . θ θ = = = = = H D 8 5 9 4 0 904 (0 904 25 3 Use candlepower from table at 25° = 3245: Fc(h) = (3245 0.904) = 33.2 fc × 9 42 . To determine the total foot-candles on the task, the same calculation must be made for each luminaire that could contribute to the illumination level. All of the contributions are then totaled. The contribution from the luminaire on the opposite side of the point will be the same as calculated above. The next pair of luminaires is close enough that their contribution must also be checked. Calculate foot-candles contributed by one luminaire: horizontal distance F = �(42 + 62) = 7.2 ft  arccos 0.763 40.27 0.76 11.14 8.5 cos = (8.5 + 7.2 ) =11.14 2 2 = = = = θ θ D ft Use value for candlepower at 45° with respect to the luminaire and interpolate between 35° and 45° values. Use 2420 for candlepower: Fc = (2420 x 0.763) ÷ (11.14)2 = 14.88 fc The foot-candle level on the task is the sum of the contributions from the four closest luminaires: Fc total = (33.2 x 2) + (14.88 x 2) = 96.16 fc Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 29 The IES Lighting Handbook contains a table to simplify these calculations. If you know the mounting height above the work plane and the horizontal distance from the task, the table provides (a) the angle to be used to enter the candlepower distribution table and (b) a multiplier to be used with the resultant candlepower to calculate foot-candle contribution on the task by the luminaire. This method is seldom used within a building except where a single workstation may exist within a larger space where a lower average level of illumination is required and a higher level is required at the workstation. This procedure is often used with outdoor lighting systems to determine the lighting levels on parking lots and roadways. It is the basis used by luminaire manufacturers in their computer programs for laying out area and roadway lighting systems. 6.11 GROUNDING Grounding system calculations must be made for substation and other areas where step potential is a concern. The subject is too complex for the DSG. Grounding system calculations must be in accordance with applicable sections of ANSI/IEEE Standard 80. 6.12 CABLE PULLING TENSION Cable pulling involves consideration of the strength of the cable to handle the maximum pulling tension required to pull it into place and for it to survive the side-wall tension applied when being pulled around a corner. Formulas for making pulling tension calculations can be found in most cable manufacturers’ handbooks. American Polywater Corporation has a software package that allows the calculations to be completed on a personal computer. The maximum pulling tension shall not exceed 0.008 times the circular mil (CM) area when pulled with a pulling eye attached to the conductors: Tm = 0.008 x n x CM Tm = maximum tension, in pounds where: n = number of conductors in cable CM = circular mil area of each conductor The maximum tension shall not exceed 1,000 pounds when cables are being pulled with a basket grip. In addition, the maximum tension calculated above shall not be exceeded. At a bend, the maximum pulling tension should not exceed 300 times the radius of the duct (in feet), and the tensions indicated above shall not be exceeded either. The minimum radius in a cable run can be calculated by the formula: R = T/300 where: T is the worst case maximum tension calculated Chapter 9 Electrical Design Appendix 9C Design Calculations for Electrical Design 30 SPU Design Standards and Guidelines November 2020 The pulling tension T in a horizontal duct run can be calculated from the following: T = (length of duct [feet]) x (weight of cable [lb per foot]) x (coefficient of friction) The coefficient of friction can vary with cable jacket, conduit type, temperature, lubricant, number of cables, and pressure of the cable against the conduit wall. Data available from the manufacturer of the pulling lubricant being specified must be used in making calculations. For pulls through curved sections, the tension required to make the pull will equal the tension required for the straight pull at the pulling end, plus a factor times the tension required for the straight section at the feeding end. The factor is equal to: efa where e = naperian logarithm base 2.718, f = coefficient of friction, and a = angle of bend in radians. Because the factor will usually exceed 1, the feeding end should be the end having the lowest straight line pulling tension requirement. Pulling of cables of different sizes into the same conduit shall be done with caution. The maximum pulling tension used must be reduced to make sure that the smaller cables are not damaged. The designer should review The Power Cable Manual (published by the Southwire Company) or Engineering Data (published by The Okonite Company), or a similar cable handbook for examples of detailed calculations. For complex calculations where bends exist in cable pulls, the designer should use software. American Polywater Corporation Pull-Planner II is a readily available software program, but others may be used where available. 6.13 EQUIPMENT HEAT LOADS Heat is generated in electrical equipment because of the electrical losses within the equipment. Electrical losses should be estimated and added to the cooling requirements of the space where the electrical equipment is installed. Table 55 in Chapter 9 of ANSI/IEEE Std 141 contains a list of energy losses for a number of types of electrical equipment. Table 9C-7 shows a brief list of energy losses for the equipment found most often in water and wastewater treatment facilities. Table 9C-7 Losses in Electrical Equipment Component Percent Energy Loss (full load) Medium-voltage switchgear 0.005 - 0.02 Transformers 0.4 - 1.90 Medium-voltage starters 0.02 - 0.15 Low-voltage switchgear 0.13 - 0.34 Low-voltage motor control 0.01 - 0.40 Cable 1.00 - 4.00 Motors 1-10 hp 14.0 - 35.0 10-200 hp 6.00 - 12.0 200-1,500 hp 4.00 - 7.00 Static variable-speed drives 5.00 - 15.0

This “Cahier Technique” reviews the calculation methods for short-circuit currents as laid down by standards such as IEC 60909. It is intended for radial and meshed low-voltage (LV) and high-voltage (HV) circuits. The aim is to provide a further understanding of the calculation methods, essential when determining short-circuit currents, even when computerised methods are employed. the impedance method Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.4 1 Introduction Electrical installations almost always require protection against short-circuits wherever there is an electrical discontinuity. This most often corresponds to points where there is a change in conductor cross-section. The short-circuit current must be calculated at each level in the installation in view of determining the characteristics of the equipment required to withstand or break the fault current. The flow chart in Figure 1 indicates the procedure for determining the various shortcircuit currents and the resulting parameters for the different protection devices of a low-voltage installation. In order to correctly select and adjust the protection devices, the graphs in Figures 2, 3 and 4 are used. Two values of the short-circuit current must be evaluated: c The maximum short-circuit current, used to determine v The breaking capacity of the circuit breakers v The making capacity of the circuit breakers v The electrodynamic withstand capacity of the wiring system and switchgear The maximum short-circuit current corresponds to a short-circuit in the immediate vicinity of the downstream terminals of the protection device. It must be calculated accurately and used with a safety margin. c The minimum short-circuit current, essential when selecting the time-current curve for circuit breakers and fuses, in particular when Upstream Ssc u (%) Isc at transformer terminals Isc of main LV switchboard outgoers Isc at head of secondary switchboards Isc at head of final switchboards Isc at end of final outgoers Conductor characteristics b Busbars v Length v Width v Thickness b Cables v Type of insulation v Single-core or multicore v Length v Cross-section b Environment v Ambient temperature v Installation method v Number of contiguous circuits Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity ST and inst. trip setting Breaking capacity Inst. trip setting Main circuit breaker Main LV switchboard distribution circuit breakers Secondary distribution circuit breakers Final distribution circuit breakers b Feeder current ratings b Voltage drops HV / LV transformer rating Load rating sc b Power factor b Coincidence factor b Duty factor b Foreseeable expansion factor Fig. 1 : Short-circuit (Isc) calculation procedure when designing a low-voltage electrical installation (ST = short time; Inst. = instantaneous) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.5 v Cables are long and/or the source impedance is relatively high (generators, UPSs) v Protection of life depends on circuit breaker or fuse operation, essentially the case for TN and IT electrical systems Note that the minimum short-circuit current corresponds to a short-circuit at the end of the protected line, generally phase-to-earth for LV and phase-to-phase for HV (neutral not distributed), under the least severe operating conditions (fault at the end of a feeder and not just downstream from a protection device, one transformer in service when two can be connected, etc.). Note also that whatever the case, for whatever type of short-circuit current (minimum or maximum), the protection device must clear the short-circuit within a time tc that is compatible with the thermal stresses that can be withstood by the protected cable: i 2 ∫ dt k A2 2 i (see Fig. 2, 3, and 4) where A is the cross-sectional area of the conductors and k is a constant calculated on the basis of different correction factors for the cable installation method, contiguous circuits, etc. Further practical information may be found in the “Electrical Installation Guide” published by Schneider Electric (see the bibliography). 1.1 The main types of short-circuits Various types of short-circuits can occur in electrical installations. Characteristics of short-circuits The primary characteristics are: c Duration (self-extinguishing, transient and steady-state) c Origin v Mechanical (break in a conductor, accidental electrical contact between two conductors via a foreign conducting body such as a tool or an animal) v Internal or atmospheric overvoltages a5 s Iz1 < Iz2 t 1 2 I2t = k2S2 I Fig. 2 : The I2t characteristics of a conductor depending on the ambient temperature (1 and 2 represent the rms value of the current in the conductor at different temperatures θ1 and θ2, with θ1 > θ2; Iz being the limit of the permissible current under steady-state conditions).

Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.7 1.2 Development of the short-circuit current A simplified network comprises a source of constant AC power, a switch, an impedance Zsc that represents all the impedances upstream of the switch, and a load impedance Zs (see Fig. 6 ). In a real network, the source impedance is made up of everything upstream of the short-circuit including the various networks with different voltages (HV, LV) and the series-connected wiring systems with different cross-sectional areas (A) and lengths. In Figure 6, when the switch is closed and no fault is present, the design current Is flows through the network. When a fault occurs between A and B, the negligible impedance between these points results in a very high short-circuit current Isc that is limited only be impedance Zsc. The current Isc develops under transient conditions depending on the reactances X and the resistances R that make up impedance Zsc: Zsc = R X 2 2 + In power distribution networks, reactance X = L ϕ is normally much greater than resistance R and the R / X ratio is between 0.1 and 0.3. The ratio is virtually equals cos ϕ for low values: cos R R X 2 2 ϕ = + However, the transient conditions prevailing while the short-circuit current develops differ depending on the distance between the fault location and the generator. This distance is not necessarily physical, but means that the generator impedances are less than the impedance of the elements between the generator and the fault location. Fault far from the generator This is the most frequent situation. The transient conditions are those resulting from the application of a voltage to a reactor-resistance circuit. This voltage is: e = E 2 sin t + (ω α) Current i is then the sum of the two components: i = i i ac dc + c The first (iac) is alternating and sinusoidal i = sin t + ac Ι 2 (ω αϕ− ) where I = E Zsc , α = angle characterising the difference between the initiation of the fault and zero voltage. c The second (idc) is an aperiodic component i dc - R L t = − - 2 si Ι αϕ n e ( ) . Its initial value depends on a and its decay rate is proportional to R / L. At the initiation of the short-circuit, i is equal to zero by definition (the design current Is is negligible), hence: i = iac + idc = 0 Figure 7 shows the graphical composition of i as the algebraic sum of its two components iac and idc Fig. 6 : Simplified network diagram.

The voltage can therefore be expressed as: u = E 2 . sin ( t + ) ω α . The current therefore develops as follows: i = E 2 Z sin t + - - - e sin - R L t (ω αϕ αϕ ) ( )         with its two components, one being alternating with a shift equal to ϕ with respect to the voltage and the second aperiodic and decaying to zero as t tends to infinity. Hence the two extreme cases defined by: c α = ϕ ≈ π / 2, said to be symmetrical (or balanced) (see Fig. a ) The fault current can be defined by: i = E 2 Z sin t ω which, from the initiation, has the same shape as for steady state conditions with a peak value E / Z. c α = 0, said to be asymmetrical (or unbalanced) (see Fig. b ) The fault current can be defined by: i = E 2 Z sin t - + sin e- R L t ( ) ωϕ ϕ         Its initial peak value ip therefore depends on ϕ on the R / X ≈ cos ϕ ratio of the circuit.

The factor e R L − t is inversely proportional to the aperiodic component damping, determined by the R / L or R / X ratios. The value of ip must therefore be calculated to determine the making capacity of the required circuit breakers and to define the electrodynamic forces that the installation as a whole must be capable of withstanding. Its value may be deduced from the rms value of the symmetrical short-circuit current Ιa using the equation: ip = κ . r . Ia, where the coefficient κ is indicated by the curve in Figure 9 , as a function of the ratio R / X or R / L, corresponding to the expression: κ = + − 1 02 0 98 3 . . e R X Fault near the generator When the fault occurs in the immediate vicinity of the generator supplying the circuit, the variation in the impedance of the generator, in this case the dominant impedance, damps the short-circuit current. The transient current-development conditions are in this case modified by the variation in the electromotive force resulting from the shortcircuit. For simplicity, the electromotive force is assumed to be constant and the internal reactance of the machine variable. The reactance develops in three stages: c Subtransient (the first 10 to 20 milliseconds of the fault) c Transient (up to 500 milliseconds) c Steady-state (or synchronous reactance) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.9 Note that in the indicated order, the reactance acquires a higher value at each stage, i.e. the subtransient reactance is less than the transient reactance, itself less than the synchronous reactance. The successive effect of the three reactances leads to a gradual reduction in the short-circuit current which is the sum of four components (see Fig. 10 ): c The three alternating components (subtransient, transient and steady-state) c The aperiodic component resulting from the development of the current in the circuit (inductive) This short-circuit current i(t) is maximum for a closing angle corresponding to the zero-crossing of the voltage at the instant the fault occurs.

Note that the decrease in the generator reactance is faster than that of the aperiodic component.

Ib is the value of the short-circuit current at the moment interruption is effective, i.e. following a time t after the beginning of the short-circuit, where t = tmin. Time tmin (minimum time delay) is the sum of the minimum operating time of a protection relay and the shortest opening time of the associated circuit breaker, i.e. the shortest time between the appearance of the short-circuit current and the initial separation of the pole contacts on the switching device. Figure 11 presents the various currents of the short-circuits defined above. 1.3 Standardised Isc calculations The standards propose a number of methods. c Application guide C 15-105, which supplements NF C 15-100 (Normes Françaises) (low-voltage AC installations), details three methods v The “impedance” method, used to calculate fault currents at any point in an installation with a high degree of accuracy. This method involves adding the various resistances and reactances of the fault loop separately, from (and including) the source to the given point, and then calculating the corresponding impedance. The Isc value is finally obtained by applying Ohm’s law: Isc = Un 3∑(Z) . All the characteristics of the various elements in the fault loop must be known (sources and wiring systems). v The “composition” method, which may be used when the characteristics of the power supply are not known. The upstream impedance of the given circuit is calculated on the basis of an Fig. 11 : short-circuit currents near a generator (schematic diagram). i Asymmetrical Symmetrical Subtrans. Transient Steady-state 2r I" k ip 2r Ik Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.11 estimate of the short-circuit current at its origin. Power factor cos ϕ ≈ R / X is assumed to be identical at the origin of the circuit and the fault location. In other words, it is assumed that the elementary impedances of two successive sections in the installation are sufficiently similar in their characteristics to justify the replacement of vectorial addition of the impedances by algebraic addition. This approximation may be used to calculate the value of the short-circuit current modulus with sufficient accuracy for the addition of a circuit. v The “conventional” method, which can be used when the impedances or the Isc in the installation upstream of the given circuit are not known, to calculate the minimum short-circuit currents and the fault currents at the end of a line. It is based on the assumption that the voltage at the circuit origin is equal to 80% of the rated voltage of the installation during the shortcircuit or the fault. Conductor reactance is neglected for sizes under 150 mm2. It is taken into account for large sizes by increasing the resistance 15% for 150 mm2, 20% for 185 mm2, 25% for 240 mm2 and 30% for 300 mm2. This method is used essentially for final circuits with origins sufficiently far from the source. It is not applicable in installations supplied by a generator. c Standard IEC 60909 (VDE 0102) applies to all networks, radial or meshed, up to 550 kV. This method, based on the Thevenin theorem, calculates an equivalent voltage source at the short-circuit location and then determines the corresponding short-circuit current. All network feeders as well as the synchronous and asynchronous machines are replaced in the calculation by their impedances (positive sequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence). All line capacitances and the parallel admittances of non-rotating loads, except those of the zero-sequence system, are neglected. 1.4 Methods presented in this document In this “Cahier Technique” publication, two methods are presented for the calculation of short-circuit currents in radial networks: c The impedance method, reserved primarily for LV networks, was selected for its high degree of accuracy and its instructive value, given that virtually all characteristics of the circuit are taken into account c The IEC 60909 method, used primarily for HV networks, was selected for its accuracy and its analytical character. More technical in nature, it implements the symmetrical-component principle 1.5 Basic assumptions To simplify the short-circuit calculations, a number of assumptions are required. These impose limits for which the calculations are valid but usually provide good approximations, facilitating comprehension of the physical phenomena and consequently the short-circuit current calculations. They nevertheless maintain a fully acceptable level of accuracy, “erring” systematically on the conservative side. The assumptions used in this document are as follows: c The given network is radial with nominal voltages ranging from LV to HV, but not exceeding 550 kV, the limit set by standard IEC 60909 c The short-circuit current, during a three-phase short-circuit, is assumed to occur simultaneously on all three phases c During the short-circuit, the number of phases involved does not change, i.e. a three-phase fault remains three-phase and a phase-to-earth fault remains phase-to-earth c For the entire duration of the short-circuit, the voltages responsible for the flow of the current and the short-circuit impedance do not change significantly c Transformer regulators or tap-changers are assumed to be set to a main position (if the short-circuit occurs away far from the generator, the actual position of the transformer regulator or tap-changers does not need to be taken into account c Arc resistances are not taken into account c All line capacitances are neglected c Load currents are neglected c All zero-sequence impedances are taken into account Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.12 2 Calculation of Isc by the impedance method 2.1 Isc depending on the different types of short-circuit Three-phase short-circuit This fault involves all three phases. Short-circuit current Isc3 is equal to: Ιsc U / 3 Zcc 3 = where U (phase-to-phase voltage) corresponds to the transformer no-load voltage which is 3 to 5% greater than the on-load voltage across the terminals. For example, in 390 V networks, the phase-to-phase voltage adopted is U = 410 V, and the phase-to-neutral voltage is U / 3 = 237 V. Calculation of the short-circuit current therefore requires only calculation of Zsc, the impedance equal to all the impedances through which Isc flows from the generator to the location of the fault, i.e. the impedances of the power sources and the lines (see Fig. 12 ). This is, in fact, the “positive-sequence” impedance per phase: Zsc = R X  ∑ ∑   +     2 2 where ∑R = the sum of series resistances, ∑X = the sum of series reactances. It is generally considered that three-phase faults provoke the highest fault currents. The fault current in an equivalent diagram of a polyphase system is limited by only the impedance of one phase at the phase-to-neutral voltage of thenetwork. Calculation of Isc3 is therefore essential for selection of equipment (maximum current and electrodynamic withstand capability). Fig. 12 : The various short-circuit currents.

In this case, the short-circuit current Isc2 is less than that of a three-phase fault: Ι ΙΙ sc U 2 Zsc = 3 2 sc 0.86 sc 2 3 3 = ≈ For a fault occuring near rotating machines, the impedance of the machines is such that Isc2 is close to Isc3. Phase-to-neutral short-circuit clear of earth This is a fault between one phase and the neutral, supplied with a phase-to-neutral voltage V = U / 3 The short-circuit current Isc1 is: Ιsc = U / 3 Zsc + Z 1 Ln In certain special cases of phase-to-neutral faults, the zero-sequence impedance of the source is less than Zsc (for example, at the terminals of a star-zigzag connected transformer or of a generator under subtransient conditions). In this case, the phase-to-neutral fault current may be greater than that of a three-phase fault. Phase-to-earth fault (one or two phases) This type of fault brings the zero-sequence impedance Zo into play. Except when rotating machines are involved (reduced zero-sequence impedance), the shortcircuit current Isco is less than that of a three phase fault. Calculation of Isco may be necessary, depending on the neutral system (system earthing arrangement), in view of defining the setting thresholds for the zero-sequence (HV) or earthfault (LV) protection devices. Figure 12 shows the various short-circuit currents. 2.2 Determining the various short-circuit impedances This method involves determining the shortcircuit currents on the basis of the impedance represented by the “circuit” through which the short-circuit current flows. This impedance may be calculated after separately summing the various resistances and reactances in the fault loop, from (and including) the power source to the fault location. (The circled numbers X may be used to come back to important information while reading the example at the end of this section.) Network impedances c Upstream network impedance Generally speaking, points upstream of the power source are not taken into account. Available data on the upstream network is therefore limited to that supplied by the power distributor, i.e. only the short-circuit power Ssc in MVA. The equivalent impedance of the upstream network is: 1 Zup = U Ssc 2 where U is the no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the network. The upstream resistance and reactance may be deduced from Rup / Zup (for HV) by: Rup / Zup ≈ 0.3 at 6 kV; Rup / Zup ≈ 0.2 at 20 kV; Rup / Zup ≈ 0.1 at 150 kV. As, Xup Za - Ra = 2 2 , Xup Zup = 1 - Rup Z pu       2 2 Therefore, for 20 kV, Xup Zup . = 1 - 0.2 ( ) = 2 0 980 Xup 0.980 Zup at 20kV, = hence the approximation Xup Zup ≈ . c Internal transformer impedance The impedance may be calculated on the basis of the short-circuit voltage usc expressed as a percentage: 3 Z u 100 U Sn T sc 2 = , U = no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the transformer; Sn = transformer kVA rating; u 100 sc = voltage that must be applied to the primary winding of the transformer for the rated current to flow through the secondary winding, when the LV secondary terminals are shortcircuited. For public distribution MV / LV transformers, the values of usc have been set by the European Harmonisation document HD 428-1S1 issued in October 1992 (see Fig. 13 ) .

For low power levels, however, calculation of ZT is required because the ratio RT / XT is higher. The resistance is calculated using the joule losses (W) in the windings: W = 3 R R W 3 n T T 2 Ι Ι n2 ⇒ = Notes: 5 v When n identically-rated transformers are connected in parallel, their internal impedance values, as well as the resistance and reactance values, must be divided by n v Particular attention must be paid to special transformers, for example, the transformers for rectifier units have Usc values of up to 10 to 12% in order to limit short-circuit currents. When the impedance upstream of the transformer and the transformer internal impedance are taken into account, the shortcircuit current may be expressed as: Ιsc = U 3 Zup ZT ( + ) Initially, Zup and ZT may be considered comparable to their respective reactances. The short-circuit impedance Zsc is therefore equal to the algebraic sum of the two. The upstream network impedance may be neglected, in which case the new current value is: Ι'sc = U 3 ZT The relative error is: ∆Ι Ι Ι Ι Ι sc sc sc - sc sc Z p Z U Ssc T u U 2 sc 2 ' = == u 100 Sn i.e. : ∆Ι Ι sc sc u Sn Ssc sc = 100 Figure 14 indicates the level of conservative error in the calculation of Isc, due to the fact that the upstream impedance is neglected. The figure demonstrates clearly that it is possible to neglect the upstream impedance for networks where the short-circuit power Ssc is much higher than the transformer kVA rating Sn. For example, when Ssc / Sn = 300, the error is approximately 5%. c Line impedance The line impedance ZL depends on the resistance per unit length, the reactance per unit length and the length of the line. v The resistance per unit length of overhead lines, cables and busbars is calculated as R A L = ρ where S = cross-sectional area of the conductor; ρ = conductor resistivity, however the value used varies, depending on the calculated short-circuit current (minimum or maximum). 6 The table in Figure 15 provides values for each of the above-mentioned cases. Practically speaking, for LV and conductors with cross-sectional areas less than 150 mm2, only the resistance is taken into account (RL < 0.15 mΩ / m when A > 150 mm2). v The reactance per unit length of overhead lines, cables and busbars may be calculated as X L 15.7 144.44 Log d r L == +            ω  Fig. 14 : Resultant error in the calculation of the short-circuit current when the upstream network impedance Zup is neglected. 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 0 5 10 12 Sn (kVA) Ssc = 250 MVA Ssc = 500 MVA ∆Isc/Isc (%) Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.15 expressed as mΩ / km for a single-phase or three-phase delta cable system, where (in mm): r = radius of the conducting cores; d = average distance between conductors. NB : Above, Log = decimal logarithm. For overhead lines, the reactance increases slightly in proportion to the distance between conductors (Log d t       ), and therefore in proportion to the operating voltage. 7 the following average values are to be used: X = 0.3 Ω / km (LV lines); X = 0.4 Ω / km (MV or HV lines). Figure 16 shows the various reactance values for conductors in LV applications, depending on the wiring system (practical values drawn from French standards, also used in other European countries). The following average values are to be used: - 0.08 mΩ / m for a three-phase cable ( ), and, for HV applications, between 0.1 and 0.15 mΩ / m. 8 - 0.09 mΩ / m for touching, single-conductor cables (flat or triangular ); 9 - 0.15 mΩ / m as a typical value for busbars ( ) and spaced, single-conductor cables ( ) ; For “sandwiched-phase” busbars (e.g. Canalis - Telemecanique), the reactance is considerably lower. Notes : v The impedance of the short lines between the distribution point and the HV / LV transformer may be neglected. This assumption gives a conservative error concerning the short-circuit current. The error increases in proportion to the transformer rating v The cable capacitance with respect to the earth (common mode), which is 10 to 20 times greater than that between the lines, must be taken into account for earth faults. Generally speaking, the capacitance of a HV three-phase cable with a cross-sectional area of 120 mm2 is in the order Fig. 16 : Cables reactance values depending on the wiring system.

If one of the values, RL or XL, is low with respect to the other, it may be neglected because the resulting error for impedance ZL is consequently very low. For example, if the ratio between RL and XL is 3, the error in ZL is 5.1%. The curves for RL and XL (see Fig. 17 ) may be used to deduce the cable cross-sectional areas for which the impedance may be considered comparable to the resistance or to the reactance. Examples : v First case: Consider a three-phase cable, at 20°C, with copper conductors. Their reactance is 0.08 mΩ / m. The RL and XL curves (see Fig. 17) indicate that impedance ZL approaches two asymptotes, RL for low cable cross-sectional areas and XL = 0.08 mΩ / m for high cable cross-sectional areas. For the low and high cable cross-sectional areas, the impedance ZL curve may be considered identical to the asymptotes. The given cable impedance is therefore considered, with a margin of error less than 5.1%, comparable to: - A resistance for cable cross-sectional areas less than 74 mm2 - A reactance for cable cross-sectional areas greater than 660 mm2 v Second case: Consider a three-phase cable, at 20 °C, with aluminium conductors. As above, the impedance ZL curve may be considered identical to the asymptotes, but for cable crosssectional areas less than 120 mm2 and greater than 1,000 mm2 (curves not shown) Impedance of rotating machines. c Synchronous generators The impedances of machines are generally expressed as a percentage, for example: x n 100 sc = I I (where x is the equivalent of the transformer usc). Consider: 10 Z = x 100 U Sn 2 where U = no-load phase-to-phase voltage of the generator, Sn = generator VA rating. 11 What is more, given that the value of R / X is low, in the order of 0.05 to 0.1 for MV and 0.1 to 0.2 for LV, impedance Z may be considered comparable to reactance X. Values for x are given in the table in Figure 18 for turbogenerators with smooth rotors and for “hydraulic” generators with salient poles (low speeds). In the table, it may seem surprising to see that the synchronous reactance for a shortcircuit exceeds 100% (at that point in time, Isc < In) . However, the short-circuit current is essentially inductive and calls on all the reactive power that the field system, even over-excited, can supply, whereas the rated current essentially carries the active power supplied by the turbine (cos ϕ from 0.8 to 1). c Synchronous compensators and motors The reaction of these machines during a shortcircuit is similar to that of generators. 12 They produce a current in the network that depends on their reactance in % (see Fig. 19 ). c Asynchronous motors When an asynchronous motor is cut from the network, it maintains a voltage across its terminals that disappears within a few hundredths of a second. When a short-circuit occurs across the terminals, the motor supplies a current that disappears even more rapidly, according to time constants in the order of: Fig. 18 : Generator reactance values. in per unit.

Consequently, the large number of LV motors, with low individual outputs, present on industrial sites may be a source of difficulties in that it is not easy to foresee the average number of motors running that will contribute to the fault when a short-circuit occurs. Individual calculation of the reverse current for each motor, taking into account the line impedance, is therefore a tedious and futile task. Common practice, notably in the United States, is to take into account the combined contribution to the fault current of all the asynchronous LV motors in an installation. 13 They are therefore thought of as a unique source, capable of supplying to the busbars a current equal to Istart/Ir times the sum of the rated currents of all installed motors. Other impedances. c Capacitors A shunt capacitor bank located near the fault location will discharge, thus increasing the shortcircuit current. This damped oscillatory discharge is characterised by a high initial peak value that is superposed on the initial peak of the shortcircuit current, even though its frequency is far greater than that of the network. Depending on the timing between the initiation of the fault and the voltage wave, two extreme cases must be considered: v If the initiation of the fault coincides with zero voltage, the short-circuit discharge current is asymmetrical, with a maximum initial amplitude peak v Conversely, if the initiation of the fault coincides with maximum voltage, the discharge current superposes itself on the initial peak of the fault current, which, because it is symmetrical, has a low value It is therefore unlikely, except for very powerful capacitor banks, that superposition will result in an initial peak higher than the peak current of an asymmetrical fault. It follows that when calculating the maximum short-circuit current, capacitor banks do not need to be taken into account. However, they must nonetheless be considered when selecting the type of circuit breaker. During opening, capacitor banks significantly reduce the circuit frequency and thus affect current interruption. c Switchgear 14 Certain devices (circuit breakers, contactors with blow-out coils, direct thermal relays, etc.) have an impedance that must be taken into account, for the calculation of Isc, when such a device is located upstream of the device intended to break the given short-circuit and remain closed (selective circuit breakers). 15 For LV circuit breakers, for example, a reactance value of 0.15 mΩ is typical, while the resistance is negligible. For breaking devices, a distinction must be made depending on the speed of opening: v Certain devices open very quickly and thus significantly reduce short-circuit currents. This is the case for fast-acting, limiting circuit breakers and the resultant level of electrodynamic forces and thermal stresses, for the part of the installation concerned, remains far below the theoretical maximum v Other devices, such as time-delayed circuit breakers, do not offer this advantage c Fault arc The short-circuit current often flows through an arc at the fault location. The resistance of the arc is considerable and highly variable. The voltage drop over a fault arc can range from 100 to 300 V. For HV applications, this drop is negligible with respect to the network voltage and the arc has no effect on reducing the short-circuit current. For LV applications, however, the actual fault current when an arc occurs is limited to a much lower level than that calculated (bolted, solid fault), because the voltage is much lower. 16 For example, the arc resulting from a shortcircuit between conductors or busbars may reduce the prospective short-circuit current by 20 to 50% and sometimes by even more than 50% for nominal voltages under 440 V. However, this phenomenon, highly favourable in the LV field and which occurs for 90% of faults, may not be taken into account when determining the breaking capacity because 10% of faults take place during closing of a device, producing a solid Fig. 19 : Synchronous compensator and motor reactance values, in per unit.

This phenomenon should, however, be taken into account for the calculation of the minimum short-circuit current. c Various impedances Other elements may add non-negligible impedances. This is the case for harmonics filters and inductors used to limit the short-circuit current. They must, of course, be included in calculations, as well as wound-primary type current transformers for which the impedance values vary depending on the rating and the type of construction. expressed in %. Z 1 Sn MR = x 100 c For the system as a whole, after having calculated all the relative impedances, the shortcircuit power may be expressed as: Ssc ZR = 1 Σ from which it is possible to deduce the fault current Isc at a point with a voltage U: Ι Σ sc = Ssc 3 U 1 3 U ZR = ΣZR is the composed vector sum of all the impedances related to elements upstream of the fault. It is therefore the relative impedance of the upstream network as seen from a point at U voltage. Hence, Ssc is the short-circuit power, in VA, at a point where voltage is U. For example, if we consider the simplified diagram of Figure 20 : At point A, Ssc = U Z U U Z LV T LV HV L 2 2       + Hence, Ssc = 1 Z U Z U T HV 2 L LV 2 + Fig. 20 : Calculating Ssc at point A. UHT ZT UBT ZC A 2.3 Relationships between impedances at the different voltage levels in an installation Impedances as a function of the voltage The short-circuit power Ssc at a given point in the network is defined by: Ssc = U 3 U Zsc 2 Ι = This means of expressing the short-circuit power implies that Ssc is invariable at a given point in the network, whatever the voltage. And the equation Ιsc U 3 Zsc 3 = implies that all impedances must be calculated with respect to the voltage at the fault location, which leads to certain complications that often produce errors in calculations for networks with two or more voltage levels. For example, the impedance of a HV line must be multiplied by the square of the reciprocal of the transformation ratio, when calculating a fault on the LV side of the transformer: 17 Z Z U U BT HT BT HT =       2 A simple means of avoiding these difficulties is the relative impedance method proposed by H. Rich. Calculation of the relative impedances This is a calculation method used to establish a relationship between the impedances at the different voltage levels in an electrical installation. This method proposes dividing the impedances (in ohms) by the square of the network line-toline voltage (in volts) at the point where the impedances exist. The impedances therefore become relative (ZR). c For overhead lines and cables, the relative resistances and reactances are defined as: R R U and X X U CR 2 CR 2 = = with R and X in ohms and U in volts. c For transformers, the impedance is expressed on the basis of their short-circuit voltages usc and their kVA rating Sn: Z 1 Sn TR s = u c 100 c For rotating machines, the equation is identical, with x representing the impedanc Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.19 2.4 Calculation example (with the impedances of the power sources, the upstream network and the power supply transformers as well as those of the electrical lines) Problem Consider a 20 kV network that supplies a HV / LV substation via a 2 km overhead line, and a 1 MVA generator that supplies in parallel the busbars of the same substation. Two 1,000 kVA parallel-connected transformers supply the LV busbars which in turn supply 20 outgoers to 20 motors, including the one supplying motor M. All motors are rated 50 kW, all connection cables are identical and all motors are running when the fault occurs. The Isc3 and ip values must be calculated at the various fault locations indicated in the network diagram (see Fig. 21 ), that is: c Point A on the HV busbars, with a negligible impedance c Point B on the LV busbars, at a distance of 10 meters from the transformers c Point C on the busbars of an LV subdistribution board c Point D at the terminals of motor M Then the reverse current of the motors must be calculated at C and B, then at D and A.

II - Fault at B (main LV switchboard busbars) [Elements concerned: (1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6)] The reactances X and resistances R calculated for the HV section must be recalculated for the LV network via multiplication by the square of the voltage ratio 17 , i.e.: 410 20 000 0 42 2 ( /, . ) = 10-3 hence X X 0.42 B A -3 = [ ] ( ) ++ + 4 2 0 15 1 5 10 . . .

What is more, if the fault arc is taken into account (see § c fault arc section 16 ), IB is reduced to a maximum value of 28,000 A and a minimum value of 17,500 A . III - Fault at C (busbars of LV sub-distribution board) [Elements concerned: (1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6) + (7, 8)] The reactances and the resistances of the circuit breaker and the cables must be added to XB and RB.

XX D C 10 m -3 =+ + ( 0 15 2 7 21 52 . . . ) = Ω and R R 10 D C m -3 = + ( 19 2 28 2 . . ) = Ω Z R X m D D 2 D 2 . = += 35 5 Ω ΙD -3 x x 700 A . = ≈ , 410 3 35 5 10 6 R X D D . = 1 31 hence κ ≈ 1.04 on the curve in figure 9 and therefore the peak ipD is equal to: 1.04 x 2 6,700 x ≈ 9,900 A As each level in the calculations makes clear, the impact of the circuit breakers is negligible compared to that of the other elements in the network. V - Reverse currents of the motors It is often faster to simply consider the motors as independent generators, injecting into the fault a “reverse current” that is superimposed on the network fault current. c Fault at C The current produced by the motor may be calculated on the basis of the “motor + cable” impedance: XM 605 2.7 10 608 m 3 = + ( ) ≈ − Ω R 10 M m -3 = + (121 19 3 140 . ) ≈ Ω ZM = 624 mΩ hence ΙM x x = ≈ − 410 3 624 10 379 3 A For the 20 motors ΙMC = 7,580 A. Instead of making the above calculations, it is possible (see 13 ) to estimate the current injected by all the motors as being equal to (Istart / Ir) times their rated current (98 A), i.e. (4.8 x 98) x 20 = 9,400 A. Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.22 This estimate therefore provides conservative protection with respect to IMC : 7,580 A. O i pMC n the basis of R / X = 0.23 = 1.51 and ⇒ = ×× = κ 1 51 2 . , 7 580 16,200 A . Consequently, the short-circuit current (subtransient) on the LV busbars increases from 11,400 A to 19,000 A and ipC from 20,200 A to 36,400 A. c Fault at D The impedance to be taken into account is 1 / 19th of ZM (19 parallel motors), plus that of the cable.

Again, it is possible to estimate the current injected by all the motors as being equal to 4.8 times their rated current (98 A), i.e. 9,400 A. The approximation again overestimates the real value of IMB. Using the fact that R / X = 0.24 = κ = 1.5 i pMB =×× = 15 2 7 . ,440 15,800 A . Taking the motors into account, the short-circuit current (subtransient) on the main LV switchboard increases from 35,070 A to 42,510 A and the peak ipB from 72,400 A to 88,200 A. However, as mentioned above, if the fault arc is taken into account, IB is reduced between 21.3 to 34 kA. c Fault at A (HV side) Rather than calculating the equivalent impedances, it is easier to estimate (conservatively) the reverse current of the motors at A by multiplying the value at B by the LV / HV transformation value 17 , i.e.: 7,440 410 20 10 152.5 A 3 × × = This figure, compared to the 6,415 A calculated previously, is negligible Rough calculation of the fault at D This calculation makes use of all the approximations mentioned above (notably 15 and 16 .

To find the peak asymmetrical ipDtotal, the above value must be increased by the contribution of the energised motors at the time of the fault A 13 i.e. 4.8 times their rated current of 98 A: 10 20 ,500+ 4.8 98 2 = 23,800 A ( ×× × ) Compared to the figure obtained by the full calculation (18,450 A), the approximate method allows a quick evaluation with an error remaining on the side of safety. Cahier Technique Schneider Electric n° 158 / p.23 3 Calculation of Isc values in a radial network using symmetrical components 3.1 Advantages of this method Calculation using symmetrical components is particularly useful when a three-phase network is unbalanced, because, due to magnetic phenomena, for example, the traditional “cyclical” impedances R and X are, normally speaking, no longer useable. This calculation method is also required when: c A voltage and current system is not symmetrical (Fresnel vectors with different moduli and imbalances exceeding 120°).This is the case for phase-to-earth or phase-to-phase short-circuits with or without earth connection c The network includes rotating machines and/or special transformers (Yyn connection, for example) This method may be used for all types of radial distribution networks at all voltage levels. 3.2 Symmetrical components Similar to the Leblanc theorem which states that a rectilinear alternating field with a sinusoidal amplitude is equivalent to two rotating fields turning in the opposite direction, the definition of symmetrical components is based on the equivalence between an unbalanced threephase system and the sum of three balanced threephase systems, namely the positivesequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence (see Fig. 23 ). The superposition principle may then be used to calculate the fault currents. In the description below, the system is defined using current Ι1 as the rotation reference, where: c Ι1(1) is the positive-sequence component c Ι1(2) is the negative-sequence component c Ι1 (0) is the zero-sequence component and by using the following operator a = e = - 1 2 j 3 2 j 2 3 π + between I1, I2, and I3. This principle, applied to a current system, is confirmed by a graphical representation (see fig. 23). For example, the graphical addition of the vectors produces, for, the following result: Ι Ι ΙΙ 2 1 = ++ a a 1 1 2 (1) (2) (3) . Currents Ι1and Ι3 may be expressed in the same manner, hence the system: ΙΙ Ι Ι 1 1 =+ + (1) (2) (0) a 1 1 Ι Ι ΙΙ 2 1 = ++ a a 1 1 2 (1) (2) (0) Ι Ι ΙΙ 3 1 = a + a 1 + 1 (1) (2) (0) 2 .

Among these characteristics, we can note that Z(2) ≈ Z(1), except for rotating machines, whereas Z(0) varies depending on each element (see Fig. 24 ). For further information on this subject, a detailed presentation of this method for calculating solid and impedance fault currents is contained in the “Cahier Technique” n° 18 (see the appended bibliography). 3.3 Calculation as defined by IEC 60909 Standard IEC 60909 defines and presents a method implementing symmetrical components, that may be used by engineers not specialised in the field. The method is applicable to electrical networks with a nominal voltage of less than 550 kV and the standard explains the calculation of minimum and maximum short-circuit currents. The former is required in view of calibrating overcurrent protection devices and the latter is used to determine the rated characteristics for the electrical equipment. Procedure 1- Calculate the equivalent voltage at the fault location, equal to c Un / 3 where c is a voltage factor required in the calculation to account for: c Voltage variations in space and in time c Possible changes in transformer tappings c Subtransient behaviour of generators and motors Depending on the required calculations and the given voltage levels, the standardised voltage levels are indicated in Figure 25 . 2- Determine and add up the equivalent positivesequence, negative-sequence and zerosequence impedances upstream of the fault location. 3- Calculate the initial short-circuit current using the symmetrical components. Practically speaking and depending on the type of fault, the equations required for the calculation of the Isc are indicated in the table in Figure 26 . 4- Once the rms value of the initial short-circuit current (I" k) is known, it is possible to calculate the other values: ip, peak value, Ib, rms value of the symmetrical short-circuit breaking current, idc, aperiodic component, Ik, rms value of the steady-state short-circuit current. Effect of the distance separating the fault from the generator When using this method, two different possibilities must always be considered: c The short-circuit is far from the generator, the situation in networks where the short-circuit currents do not have a damped, alternating component This is generally the case in LV networks, except when high-power loads are supplied by special HV substations; c The short-circuit is near the generator (see fig. 11), the situation in networks where the short-circuit currents do have a damped, alternating component. This generally occurs in HV systems, but may occur in LV systems when, for example, an emergency generator supplies priority outgoers.

Peak short-circuit current ip Peak value ip of the short-circuit current In no meshed systems, the peak value ip of the shortcircuit current may be calculated for all types of faults using the equation: i 2 p k " = κ Ι where I" k = is the initial short-circuit current, κ = is a factor depending on the R / X and can be calculated approximately using the following equation (see fig.9) : κ = 1.02 + 0.98 e -3R X Short-circuit breaking current Ib Calculation of the short-circuit breaking current Ib is required only when the fault is near the generator and protection is ensured by timedelayed circuit breakers. Note that this current is used to determine the breaking capacity of these circuit breakers. This current may be calculated with a fair degree of accuracy using the following equation: Ib = µ . I" k where: where µ = is a factor defined by the minimum time delay tmin and the I" k / Ir ratio (see Fig. 27 ) which expresses the influence of the subtransient and transient reactances, with Ir as the rated current of the generator. Steady-state short-circuit current Ik The amplitude of the steady-state short-circuit current Ik depends on generator saturation influences and calculation is therefore less accurate than for the initial symmetrical curren I" k. The proposed calculation methods produce a sufficiently accurate estimate of the upper and lower limits, depending on whether the shortcircuit is supplied by a generator or a synchronous machine. c The maximum steady-state short-circuit current, with the synchronous generator at its highest excitation, may be calculated by: Ikmax = λmax Ir c The minimum steady-state short-circuit current is calculated under no-load, constant (minimum) excitation conditions for the synchronous generator and using the equation: Ikmin = λmin Ir λ is a factor defined by the saturated synchronous reactance Xd sat. The λmax and λmin values are indicated on next the page in Figure 28 for turbo-generators and in Figure 29 for machines with salient poles (series 1 in IEC 60909).

A number of these methods were initially designed in such a way that short-circuit currents could be calculated by hand or using a small calculator. Over the years, the standards have been revised and the methods have often been modified to provide greater accuracy and a better representation of reality. However, in the process, they have become more complicated and time-consuming, as is demonstrated by the recent changes in IEC 60909, where hand calculations are possible only for the most simple cases. With the development of ever more sophisticated computerised calculations, electrical-installation designers have developed software meeting their particular needs. Today, a number of software packages comply with the applicable standards, for example Ecodial, a program designed for low-voltage installations and marketed by Schneider Electric. All computer programs designed to calculate short-circuit currents are predominantly concerned with: c Determining the required breaking and making capacities of switchgear and the electromechanical withstand capabilities of equipment c Determining the settings for protection relays and fuse ratings to ensure a high level of discrimination in the electrical network Other software is used by experts specialising in electrical network design, for example to study the dynamic behaviour of electrical networks. Such computer programs can be used for precise simulations of electrical phenomena over time and their use is now spreading to include the entire electro-mechanical behaviour of networks and installations. Remember, however, that all software, whatever its degree of sophistication, is only a tool. To ensure correct results, it should be used by qualified professionals who have acquired the relevant knowledge and experience.

Although their backgrounds and professional skills are similar, chemical engineers work in a wide variety of industries, in addition to chemicals and petroleum, such as: Biotechnology Lime and cement Consulting Man-made fibers Drugs and pharmaceuticals Metallurgical and metal products Fats and oils Paints, varnishes, and pigments Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals Pesticides and herbicides Environment Waste water treatment All the industries as mentioned above are involving numerous of chemical process unit. Therefore, chemical engineers play an important role on design, operation, control, troubleshooting, research and management in the chemical process. Chemical process is a combination of process equipment designed to efficiently convert raw materials into finished or intermediate products. Figure 1 shows the example of chemical processes converting the raw material into desired product. Figure 1.1: Chemical process 1.2 Units and Dimensions “What are units and dimensions and how do they differ?” Dimensions are basic concepts of measurement such as length (L), mass (M), time (t), temperature (T), amount of substance (n) and so on. Besides, units are the mean of expressing the dimensions as feet or centimeters for length, or hours or seconds for time. By attaching units to all numbers that are not fundamentally dimensionless, you are able to easy interrelating the physical meaning to the numbers use. Moreover, a logical 1 approach to the problem rather than remembering a formula and plugging numbers could also help the chemical engineers in engineering calculation. SI units are universally accepted for engineering calculation. Thus, American engineering system (based on British standards) is still used extensively in the U.S. Example 1.1 What are the dimensions of mass flux (mass flow rate per unit area perpendicular to the flow)? G A dm dt = 1 L t M 2 dimensions are The rules for handling units are essentially quite simple by addition, subtraction or equality. ¾ Values could be added if UNITS are the same. ¾ Values cannot be added if DIMENSIONS are different. Example 1.2 (i) 6 ft + 10 0 C =??? * Different dimensions: length, temperature -- cannot be added * Same dimension: length, different units -- can add 2 Table 1.1: SI Units Physical Quantity Name of Unit Symbol for Unit* Definition of Unit Basic SI Units Length metre, meter m Mass kilogramme, kilogram kg Time second s Temperature kelvin K Amount of substance mole mol Derived Sl Units Energy joule J kg.m2 .s -2 Force newton N kg.m.s-2 = J.m-1 Power watt W kg.m2 .s-3 = J.s-1 Density kilogram per cubic meter kg.m-3 Velocity meter per second rn.s -1 Acceleration meter per second squared rn.s-2 Pressure newton per square meter, pascal N.m-2, Pa Heat Capacity joule per (kilogram - kelvin) J.kg-1 ,K-1 Alternative Units Time minute, hour, day, year min, h, d, y Temperature degree Celsius °C Mass tonne, ton (Mg), gram t, g Volume litre, liter (dm3 ) L Table 1.2: American Engineering System Units Physical Quantity Name of Unit Symbol Basic Units Length feet ft Mass pound (mass) lbm Force pound (force) lbf Time second, hour s, hr Temperature degree Rankine °R Derived Units Energy British thermal unit, foot pound (force) Btu, (ft)(lbf) Power horsepower hp Density pound (mass) per cubic foot lbm/ft3 Velocity feet per second ft/s Acceleration feet per second squared ft/s2 Pressure pound (force) per square inch lbf/in2 Heat capacity Btu per pound (mass) per degree F Btu/lbm. 0 F 3 1.3 Conversion of Units Conversion factors are statements of equivalent values of different units in the same system or between systems of units. The concept is to multiply any number and its associated units with dimensionless ratios termed conversion factors to arrive at desired answer and its associated units. The factors for conversion units are show in table 1.3.

The atomic weights of all the elements in their naturally isotopic proportions are listed in the table given. The molecular weight of a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms that constitute a molecule of the compound: For example atomic oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16 and therefore molecular oxygen (O2) has a molecular weight of approximately 32. A gram-mole (g-mole or mol in SI units) of a 9 species is the amount of that species whose mass in grams is numerically equal to its molecular weight.

Thus, iii. mol C 2.273 mol C ( Moreover, there are other types of moles such as kg-moles, lb-moles, and ton-moles. For example: Carbon monoxide (CO) has a molecular weight of 28; 1 mol of CO therefore contains 28g, 1 lb-mole contains 28 lbm, 1 ton-mole contains 28 tons and so on. Besides, the same factors used to convert masses from a unit to another can also be used to convert the equivalent molar units: there is 454 g/lb for m 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 100 g CO2 1 mol CO2 44.01 g CO2 E H = 2.273 m l CO o 2 1 lb-mol Each molecules of CO2 contains one atom of C, one molecule of O2 or two atoms of O.

They are almost always prerequisite to all other calculations in the solution of process engineering problems. Material balances are nothing more than the application of the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed. Thus, as an example, you cannot specify an input to a reactor of one ton of naphtha and an output of two tons of gasoline or gases or anything else. One ton of total material in o A material balance is an accounting for material. Thus, material balances are often compared to the balancing of current accounts.

The internal energy of a system depends almost entirely on the chemical composition, state of aggregation (solid, liquid, or gas), and temperature of the system materials. If no temperature chemical reactions occur in a closed system and if pressure changes are less than a few atmospheres, then ∆ ≈ U 0. 2. If a system is not accelerating, then ∆ EK = 0. If a system is not rising or falling, then ∆ EP = 0. 3. If a system and its surroundings are at the same temperature or the system is perfectly insulated, then Q = 0. The process is then termed adiabatic. 4. Work done on or by a closed system is accomplished by movement of the system boundary against a resisting force or the passage of an electrical current or radiation across the system boundary. If there no moving parts or electrical current at the system boundary, then W = 0. en System is done on the surrounding by mass that emerges from the systems. ` Both work terms must be include in the energy balance for open system. 3.7 Energy Balances on Op ` In open system, mass is transferred across the system boundaries while the process is taking place. ` Therefore work must be done on open system to push mass in and work 38 ` he net ork d y an open system; process fluid on a moving part within the d at the system outlet minus rate of ol is used to denote the specific property (property divided by mass or by T w one b where; & - shaft work (rate of work done by the WS system such as a pump rotor.) & - flow work (rate of work done by the flui Wfl work done by the fluid at the system inlet.) ` ^ symb mole) such as specific internal energy (U ) kJ/kg), specific volume ( V ) m3 /kg) and so on. ` ne important property for energy balance on open system is specific enthalpy ( O Hˆ kJ/kg). ` Sometimes, universal gas law constant can be used as a conversion factor to cific enthalpy. of helium at this temperature and pressure, and the rate at which enthalpy is ansported by a stream of helium at 300 K and 1 atm with a molar flowrate of 250 Solution: o convert L.atm/mol into J/mol, we need the factor J/(L.atm).

The phase diagram shows, in pressure-temperature space, 41 the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas. The phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the critical point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable, in what is known as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around Tc=647.096 K (1,164.773 °R), pc=22.064 MPa (3,200.1 psi) and ρc=356 kg/m³.

Heat transfer is thermal energy in transit due to a temperature difference. In other words, heat transfer is to predict the energy transfer between material bodies. [In the simplest of terms, the discipline of heat transfer is concerned with only two things: temperature, and the flow of heat. Temperature represents the amount of thermal energy available, whereas heat flow represents the movement of thermal energy from place to place.] o How Science of heat transfer explain: ¾ How heat energy may be transfer? ¾ Predict the rate at which the exchange will take place? ¾ Different between thermodynamics and heat transfer ? o Thermodynamics deal with system in equilibrium, it may used to predict of energy required to change a system from one equilibrium state to another. But it does not predict how fast a change will take place. Example 6.1 Consider the cooling of a hot steel bar which is placed in a pail of water. Thermodynamics may used to predict the final equilibrium temperature of steel bar-water combination. However, thermodynamics will not tell: ¾ how long to reach the equilibrium or, ¾ what the temperature of steel bar after certain length of time? 67 Table 6.1: Comparison between heat transfer and thermodynamics HEAT TRANSFER THERMODYNAMICS • Heat transfer is a study which predicts the energy transfer which takes place between material bodies. • It is due to the temperature difference • Heat transfer explains how heat energy may be transferred. • It also predicts the rate at which the exchange will take place under certain condition. • Thermodynamics deals with systems in equilibrium. • Thermodynamics may used to predict the amount of energy required to change a system from one equilibrium state to another. • Thermodynamics may not used to predict how fast a change will take place since the system is not in equilibrium during the process. Three modes of heat transfer are: (1) Conduction (2) Convection (3) Radiation 6.2 Conduction Heat Transfer o Energy transfer from high temperature region to low temperature region. We said that the energy is transferred by conduction. And, the heat transfer rate per unit area is proportional to the normal temperature gradient. q/A ~ dT/dx where, q/A = heat transfer rate (W/m2 ) dT/dx = temperature gradient in the direction of the heat flow When proportionality constant is inserted, q = - kA dT/dx [6.1] o The positive constant k = thermal conductivity of the material. The minus (-) sign is inserted so that the second principle of thermodynamics will be satisfied i.e. heat must flow downhill on the temperature scale as indicated in Figure 6.1. 68 Equation (8.0) is called Fourier’s Law of heat conduction. Above is defining equation for the thermal conductivity and k has the unit of Watts per meter per Celsius degree (W/m.0 C), which the heat flow is expressed in watts. Figure 6.1: Sketch showing direction of heat flow Table 6.2: Lists typical values of the thermal conductivities of some metal (thermal conductivity at 300 K(W/m K)). Metal k Copper, pure 396 Aluminium 238 Carbon steel, 1% C 42 Plastics 0.2 - 0.3 Air 0.026 69 Figure 6.2: One –dimensional plane wall o Consider the one-dimensional plane wall shown in Figure above, if the system in a steady state, i.e., if the temperature does not change with time, then only integrate Equation (8.0) and substitute the appropriate values. 1 0 2 x T T q dx kdT A = ∫ ∫ o Where temperature at the left face (x=0) is uniform at T1 and the temperature at right face is uniform at T2. If k is independent of T, we obtain after integration : 2 q T T 1 k A L − = − o Under the steady state conditions, where the distribution is linear, the temperature gradient may be expressed as: T T 2 1 dT dx L − = o And the heat transfer rate: T T 2 1 q k A L − = − or; T T 1 2 q T k k A L L − Δ = = 70 o Since dT/dx = - q/k for the same q, if k is low (i.e: for an insulator), dT/dx will be large .i.e. there will be a large temperature difference across the wall, and if k is high (i.e. for a conductor), dT/dx will be small, or there will be a small temperature difference across the wall. Example 6.2 One face of a copper plate 3 cm thick is maintained at 400 °C, and the other face maintained at 100 °C. How much heat is transferred through the plate? Given: k = 370 W/m.K. From Fourier’s Law, q d k A d = − T x Integrating gives ( ) 2 370 / . (100 400) 3 10 q T W mK K k A x m− Δ − − =− = Δ × q/A = 3.7 MW/m 2 6.3 Convection Heat Transfer o It is well known that hot plate of metal will cool faster when placed in front of a fan than when exposed to still air. We say that, heat is convected away, and we call the process, convection heat transfer. The velocity at which the air blows over the hot plate obviously influence the heat transfer rate. 6.3.1 Mechanism of convection o Consider the heated plate shown on Figure 8.3. Temperature of plate is Tw and temperature of the fluid is T∞. The velocity of the flow will appear as shown in the figure. 71 Figure 6.3: Convection heat transfer from a plate o The velocity is being reduced to zero at the plate as a result of viscous action. Since the velocity of fluid layer at the wall will be zero, the heat must be transferred only by conduction. Thus we might compute the heat transfer, using: q = -kA (dT/dx) but with little changes. We use thermal conductivity of fluid and the fluid temperature gradient at the wall.The temperature gradient is dependent on the rate at which the fluid carries the heat away. High velocity produces a large temperature gradient. Thus, the temperature gradient at the wall depends on the flow field. To express the overall effect of convection, we use Newton’s law of cooling: q = hA (Tw-T∞) [6.2] where, h = convection heat-transfer coefficient (heat-transfer coefficient = film conductance) h = watt per square meter per Celsius degree (W/m² .°C) when the heat flow is in Watt. o Heat-transfer rate is related to overall temperature difference between the wall and fluid and the surface area. 6.3.2 Free and Forced Convection o If heated plate were exposed to ambient room air without an external source of motion, a movement of the air would be experienced as a result of the density gradients near the plate. o We call this as free convection. When the mass motion of the fluid is caused by an external device like a pump, compressor, blower or fan, the process is called forced convection. Example 6.3 72 Air at 20 °C blows over a hot plate 50 by 75 cm maintained at 250 °C. The convection heat transfer coefficient is 25 W/m².°C. Calculate the heat transfer? Solution: From Newton’s Law of cooling; ( ) w q hA T T = − ∞ q = (25)W/m2 .K (0.5x0.75) m2 (250-20)K q = 2.156 kW Example 6.4 An electric current is passed through a wire 1 mm in diameter and 10 cm long. The wire is submerged in liquid water at atmospheric pressure, and the current is increased until the water boils. For this situation h = 5000 W/m².°C, and the water temperature will be 100 °C. How much electric power must be supplied to the wire to maintain the wire surface at 114 °C. Solution: Total convection loss is ( ) w q hA T T = − ∞ The surface area of the wire A = πdL = π (1x10 -3 )(10x10 -2 ) = 3.142 x 10 -4 m 2 Therefore, the heat transfer is q = (5000w/m².°C)(3.142 x 10 -4 m²)(114-100) = 21.99 W and this is equal to the electric power which must be applied. 6.4 Radiation Heat Transfer o Heat may also transfer through regions where perfect vacuum exist. The mechanism in this case is electromagnetic radiation which is propagated as a result of a temperature difference. This is called thermal radiation. o This is confirmed by our experienced everyday experience of being warmed by the sun, which separated from the earth by approximately 1.5 x 1011 m of empty space. o Thermal radiation can of course transport through any ‘transparent’ medium such as air. Ideal thermal radiator, or black body, will emit energy at a rate 73 q emitted = σAT4 [6.3] where; σ is the proportionality constant and is called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant with value of 5.669 x 10 -8 W/m 2 .K 4 . o This equation is called Stefan-Boltzmann law of thermal radiation and it apply to only blackbodies. This equation is valid only for thermal radiation; other type of electromagnetic radiation may not be treated so simply. q emitted = σAT4 govern only radiation emitted by a blackbody. The net radian exchange between two surface will be proportional to the difference in absolute temperature to the fourth power. i.e: q net exchange/ A  (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) q net exchange/ A = σ (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) 6.4.1 Blackbody o It is a perfect emitter of radiation. At a particular temperature the blackbody would emit the maximum amount of energy possible for that temperature. o This value is known as the blackbody radiation. It would emit at every wavelength of light as it must be able to absorb every wavelength to be sure of absorbing all incoming radiation. o The maximum wavelength emitted by a blackbody radiator is infinite. It also emits a definite amount of energy at each wavelength for a particular temperature, so standard black body radiation curves can be drawn for each temperature, showing the energy radiated at each wavelength (Fig. 6.4). 74 Figure 6.4: Theoretical black body curve for 5000K o Again, blackbody is a body which radiates energy according to the T 4 law. Other type of surface, such as glossy painted surface or a polished metal plate, do not radiate as much energy as the blackbody. o However, the total radiation emitted by this body still generally follows the T1 4 proportionality. To take account of the “gray” nature of such surfaces we introduce another factor, called the emissivity,  which relates the radiation of the “gray” surface to that of an ideal black surface. In addition, we must take into account the fact that not all the radiation leaving one surface will reach the other surface since electromagnetic radiation travels in straight line and some will lost to the surrounding. o Therefore two new factors in (Eq 8.2)take into account both situation, so that q= F F G σ A (T1 4 - T 2 4 ) [6.4] F = emissivity function F G = geometric “view factor” function A simple radiation problem is encounter when we have a heat-transfer surface at temperature T1 completely enclosed by much larger surface maintained at T2. The net radiant exchange in this case can be calculated with, q =  1 Aσ 1 (T 4 1 - T 4 2 ) where,  1 = emissivity of material Example 6.5 Two infinite black plates at 800 0 C and 300 0 C exchange heat by radiation. Calculate the heat transfer per unit area. Given: σ = 5.669 x 10 -8 W/m 2 .K 4 Solution: q/A = σ (T1 4 – T 2 4 ) = 5.669 X 10 -8 )W/m 2 .K 4 (10734 - 5734)K 4 = 69.03 kW/m 2 75 Problems 1. If 3 kW is conducted through a section of insulating material 0.6 m2 in crosssection and 2.5 cm thick and the thermal conductivity may be taken as 0.2 W/m0 C, compute the temperature difference across the material. 2. A temperature difference of 850 C is impressed across a fiberglass layer of 13 cm thickness. The thermal conductivity of the fiberglass is 0.035 W/m.0 C. Compute the heat transferred through the material per hour per unit area. 3. Two perfectly black surfaces are constructed so that all the radiant energy leaving a surface at 8000 C reaches the other surface. The temperature of the other surface is maintained at 2500 C. Calculate the heat transfer between the surfaces per hour and per unit area of the surface maintained at 8000 C. 4. One side of a plane wall is maintained at 100 C, while the other side is exposed to a convection having T = 100 C and h=10 W/m2.0 C. The wall has k = 1.6 W/m.0 C and is 40 cm thick. Calculate the heat transfer rate through the wall. 0 5. A vertical square plate, 30cm on a side, is maintained at 500 C and exposed to room air at 200 C. The surface emissivity is 0.8. Calculate the total heat lost by both sides of the plate. CHAPTER 7 HEAT EXCHANGERS 7.1 Introduction A heat exchanger is a device that facilitates exchange of heat between two fluids that are at different temperatures and separated by a solid wall. In other words, heat exchangers are devices built for efficient heat transfer from one fluid to another and are widely used in engineering processes. The specific applications of heat exchanger are space heating and air conditioning, power production, waste heat recovery, food and chemical processing, oil refining, and in vehicles. 76 7.2 Heat exchanger types Heat exchangers are classified according to flow arrangement and type of construction. Six (6) types of heat exchanger are: (a) Concentric Tube Heat Exchangers (b) Cross-Flow Heat Exchangers (c) Cross-counter Flow (Coil) Heat Exchangers (d) Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers (e) Compact Heat Exchangers (f) Plate-Type Heat Exchangers (a) Concentric Tube Heat Exchanger ƒ It also called double-pipe heat exchangers or co-axial flow heat exchangers [Figure 7.1]. ƒ One fluid flows inside the tube and the other fluid flows inside the annulus. ƒ In parallel-flow heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end, and travel in parallel to exit at the other side. [Figure7.2a] ƒ In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. Counter current design is more efficient, in that it can transfer more heat [Figure 7.2b]. Figure 7.1: Concentric tube heat exchangers (a) Parallel flow (b) Counterflow Figure 7.2: Concentric tube heat exchangers 77 (b) Cross Flow Heat Exchanger ƒ In a cross-flow heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger. ƒ In finned tubular heat exchangers, the fin-side fluid is unmixed because the fins confine the flow to one direction. Example: automobile radiator. ƒ In unfinned tubular heat exchangers, the fin-side fluid is mixed because the flow in transverse direction is possible. [Figure 7.3] ƒ The use of fins to improve the convection coefficient of fin-side fluid by increasing the outside surface area.

One fluid flows inside the tubes and the other flows inside the shell. ƒ Figure 8.5, show the simplest form of shell and tube heat exchanger which involves single tube and shell passes. ƒ Figure 7.5: Shell and tube heat exchanger with one-shell pass one-tube pass (1-1) (a) Two-pass (b) Four-pass (cross-counterflow mode of operation) ƒ Baffles are usually installed to increase the convection coefficient of the shell-side fluid by inducing turbulence and a cross-flow velocity component. 79 ƒ Baffled heat exchanger with one shell pass and two tube passes and with two shell passes and four tube passes are shown in Figures 7.6a and 7.6b, respectively. Figure 7.6: Shell-and-tube heat exchanger. (a) One shell pass and two tube passes. (b) Two shell passes and four tube passes ƒ Shell-and-tube heat exchangers are classified according to the number of shell and tube passes involved. ƒ Heat exchangers in which all the tubes make one U-turn in the shell, for example, are called one-shell-pass and two-tube-passes heat exchangers. ƒ Heat exchanger that involves two passes in the shell and four passes in the tubes is called a two-shell-passes and four-tube-passes heat exchanger [Figure 7.7] 80 (a) One-shell pass and two-tube passes (b) Two-shell passes and four-tube passes Figure 7.7: Multipass flow arrangement in shell-and-tube heat exchangers (e) Compact Heat Exchanger ƒ Used to achieve very large heat transfer area per unit volume. ƒ Have dense arrays of finned tubes or plates. ƒ Typically used when at least one of the fluids is a gas, characterized by small convection coefficient. ƒ The tubes may be flat or circular, and the fins may be plate or circular (Figure 7.8a, 7.8b and 7.8c). ƒ Parallel plates may be finned or corrugated and may be used in single-pass or multi-pass mode (Figure 7.8d and 7.8e). 81 Figure 7.8: Compact heat exchanger cores.

In most simple systems this is the log mean temperature difference (LMTD). Sometimes direct knowledge of the LMTD is not available and the NTU method is used. • The LMTD approach to heat-exchanger analysis is useful when inlet and outlet temperature are known or are easily determined. • However, when the inlet or exit temperatures are to be evaluated for a given heat exchanger, the analysis involves an interactive procedure because of the logarithmic function in the LMTD. • In these cases the analysis is performed more easily by utilizing a method based on the effectiveness of the heat exchanger in transferring a given amount of heat. • The heat exchanger effectiveness can be define as: Actual rate of heat transfer , Maximum possible rate of heat transfer Effectiveness ε = • The actual rate heat transfer, q may be computed by calculating either the energy lost by the hot fluid or the energy gained by the cold fluid. • For the parallel-flow exchanger: . . 12 21 h c ()( hh h cc c q mc T T mc T T = −= − ) • For the counter-flow exchanger : 94 . . 12 12 h c ()( hh h cc c q mc T T mc T T = −= − ) ) • The maximum possible heat transfer, qmax is the rate of heat transfer that a heat exchanger of infinite area would transfer with given inlet temperatures, flow rates, and specific heat. • qmax occurs when the fluid with minimum product of flow rate and specific heat changes temperature to the entering temperature of the other fluid. • Maximum possible heat transfer is expressed as . max min ( )( hi ci q mc T T = − • The minimun fluid may be either hot or cold fluid depending on mass-flowrates, m and specific heats, c. • For the parallel exchanger : . . . 12 12 . 1 1 1 1 ( ) ( ) h hh h h h h c h hh c mc T T T T T T mc T T ε − − = = − − . . . 21 21 . 1 1 1 1 ( ) ( ) c cc c c c h c c ch c mc T T T T T T mc T T ε − − = = − − Figure 7.19 : Temperature profile for parallel exchanger 95 • For the counterflow exchanger : . . . 12 12 . 1 2 1 2 ( ) ( ) h hh h h h h c h hh c mc T T T T T T mc T T ε − − = = − − . . . 12 12 . 1 2 1 2 ( ) ( ) c cc c c c h c c ch c mc T T T T T T mc T T ε − − = = − − Figure 7.20: Temperature profile for parallel exchanger • In the general way the effectiveness is expressed as : T ( minimum fluid) Maximum temperature difference in heat exchanger ε Δ = • The effectiveness is usually written for parallel flow double pipe HE : . .. . . 1 exp[( / )(1 / ) 1 / c ch c c c h c h UA m c m c m c mc mc ε −− + = + h min min max min max 1 exp[( / )(1 / ) 1 / UA C C C C C ε −− + = + where = capacity rate .

Cassette based document handling system
Abstract
A cassette (20) for a currency handling system includes a door (28) that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the cassette. An end door (30) is operable to be opened to allow currency that is disposed within the interior of the cassette (20) to be urged outward. The cassette (20) has a locking mechanism disposed in an end (72), which locking mechanism prevents the door from opening until the cassette (20) is disposed in a docking station. Once in the docking station, a paddle (56) is urged downward into the cassette (20) to urge the notes outward therefrom. These notes are moved into a buffer region (58) and then the cassette (20) can be removed to allow another cassette (20) to be disposed therein. This allows a continuous feeding operation. The cassette (20) can then be disposed in a second collection docking station to collect the output of the sorter (41). In this docking station, a paddle (68) is reciprocated downward into the cassette (20) with the collected notes.

Description
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention pertains in general to a document handling system and, more particularly, to a currency handling system that utilizes a cassette for transporting currency between stations.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
After currency is distributed in the public sector, it will typically find its way back into the banking institutions. This is facilitated through individuals depositing currency documents in their local banking institutions, and businesses forwarding their cash receipts to the banking institutions. Once the banking institutions have received the currency in the form of the notes, these notes must then be processed. Although the processing can be facilitated by hand, this is somewhat tedious. To facilitate the large number of notes that must be sorted, counted and then re-bundled or "strapped" for distribution back to the banks, large high speed currency sorting machines have been developed.
Currency sorting machines typically have a feeder slot into which stacks of currency in different denominations and even different sizes can be placed. The currency sorter will then individually strip the notes or documents from the feeder slot, pass them through various sensing stations to determine the denomination of the note and even the quality or integrity of the note. Once this is done, then the sorting machine will deposit the note in a collection slot associated with the proper denomination. Typically, a separate collection slot is provided for notes that are defective due to, for example, a tear or excessive wear. These sorting machines can sort notes at rates up to 2,000 notes per minute.
The disadvantage to present sorting systems is the manner in which the notes must be transported between stations. Typically, there are three stations, the first being the initial hand sorting or collection operation at the original banking institution, the second being the feeder operation to the sorter and the third being the collection operation at the sorter. Due to the high speed nature of the sorter, the sorter typically outstrips the speed at which the documents can be placed into the sorter and then removed from the sorter. Therefore, there exists a need for a system that will facilitate an increase in the throughput.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention disclosed and claimed herein comprises a method and apparatus for transferring documents utilizing a portable cassette having a cover that can be opened to expose the documents or closed in a secured and locked manner to prevent access to documents contained therein. The cassette is loaded at a first station in an open configuration to provide a stack of documents therein, and, after loading, the cassette is locked. The loaded cassette is then transported to a second location in the locked configuration, and then disposed in an unloading docking station.
The loaded cassette is opened to expose at least one end of the stack, and then the stack of documents in the loaded cassette is urged out of the loaded cassette through the at least one end into a buffer region that is continually moving. This allows the contents of the cassette to become part of the documents in the buffer region. The cassette is removed after urging the documents therefrom and after the documents have cleared the at least one end. The unloading operation is then continuously repeated with a new loaded cassette.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a diagrammatic view of the process flow for a document handling system of the present invention, which utilizes a cassette for transporting currency. The process flow is provided by three stations, a hand load station 10, a feeder station 12 and a collection station 14. Initially, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, currency is hand loaded into a cassette. Typically, the cassettes are delivered to a banking institution in an open configuration, there being a locking system that allows the cassette to be placed into a closed and secure configuration. These cassettes are stacked in a compact manner such that an operator can remove the open cassette from the stack, place it on what is referred to as a "desktop station" and then proceed to load the currency therein. Typically, the currency is counted at the banking institution by hand, placed in some type of bundle and then disposed in the cassette. There may be some type of separator card with a bar code disposed thereon which can be utilized at the central banking institution for identification. Once the currency is hand loaded into the cassette, the cassette is then closed and placed in a secure configuration. Once it is in this configuration, it cannot be opened until it is placed onto another docking station that has a key system for unlocking the cassette.
After the cassettes are hand loaded and secured, they are then placed on some type of transport or given to an individual that has the responsibility for the transport. The loaded cassettes are then transported to a sorting facility. The sorting facility contains both the feeder station 12 and the collection station 14. Of course, the sorting facility may be in the next room from the hand loading station 10. At the feeder station 12, the loaded cassettes can be sequentially disposed in the feeder station to allow high speed feeding and high speed sorting. Further, as will be described hereinbelow, this is a continuous feeding operation.
In the continuous feeding operation, a cassette is retrieved from the transport mechanism or the stack and placed onto a docking station associated with the feeding station 12. When it is placed on the docking station, this action unlocks the cassette and allows the door for the cassette to be opened and providing access to the contents. Once access is obtained, then the operator configures the feeding station to urge the notes out of the cassettes and into a buffer region. Once all the bills are urged out of cassette and into the buffer region, the cassette can then be removed in an open position and then a new loaded and locked cassette placed therein and the procedure continues.
Once the cassette is placed into the feeder station 12, the bills that are accessed are placed behind the previous notes in the buffer region. Therefore, the interior of the cassette and the buffer region constitute a feeding supply to the sorting system. The urging of the notes out of the cassette is the same operation that urges the notes in the buffer region up into interface with the sorting mechanism. This is a constant operation with the notes continually urged upward into the sorting mechanism, such that when a new cassette is placed into the feeding mechanism, the previous notes are still in the buffer region to provide a "seamless" feeding operation. The notes are fed at approximately 1,500 notes per minute and a typical cassette will contain about 2,000 notes.
The sorting mechanism is operable to retrieve the notes from the feeding mechanism, evaluate those notes for the integrity of the notes, orientation and also the denomination of the notes. The notes are then "slotted" into different collection slots. The open cassettes are placed into a docking station in the collection slot, similar to the docking station in the feeder slot, and then the notes collected therein. Once the notes are collected, the cassette can then be locked and removed for subsequent processing.
Referring now to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a block diagram of desktop station 16 for use in the hand loading station 10. The desktop station 16 is a box that has a tilted receiving surface 18. The tilted receiving surface 18 is operable to receive a cassette 20 on the surface thereof The desktop station 16 has at the lower end of the surface 18 a tilting door 22, which door 22 is operable to cover a locking mechanism (not shown). The door 22 is spring loaded, such that when the cassette 20 is removed, the door 22 will swing closed to cover the locking mechanism. This provides both a protective cover and a technique to ensure that the cassette 20 will be placed on the surface 18 above the locking mechanism, such that it will be on the same plane as the locking mechanism before engaging the locking mechanism.
The cassette 20 is comprised of a left side 24 and a right side 26. A tambour door 28 is disposed on the cassette 20, such that it can be pulled over the top opening of the cassette 20. An end door 30 is provided on one end thereof which is operable to cover an end opening. Therefore, the door 28 can be slidingly moved over the top opening and a portion of the end opening and, in conjunction with the door 30, completely seal the cassette 20. A window 32 is provided on the right side 26 and a window 36 is provided on the left side 24, which windows 32 and 36 are operable to allow a user to view the interior contents thereof to determine if there are notes in the cassette 20 after locking. A sliding compression panel 38 is provided which slides along the length of the interior of the cassette 20 to allow notes 40 which are disposed between the compression panel 38 and the opening to be stacked tightly within the cassette 20. The operation of the cassette 20 and the interior workings thereof will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
In the operation of the desktop station 16, the cassette 20 is operable to the stored in a stacked configuration with other cassettes 20, all the cassettes 20 being in an open configuration in the preferred embodiment. When a user desires to fill one of the cassettes 20, the open cassette 20 is retrieved from its storage area and disposed on the desktop station 16. It is not necessary for the desktop station 16 to have an interfacing locking mechanism that is disposed under the door 22, but this is available and shown in this embodiment. The only purpose for the mechanism under the door 22 is to provide a key mechanism for unlocking the locking mechanism internal to the cassette 20. Again, this will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
The operator, after disposing the cassette 20 on the desktop station 16, then hand loads the notes 40 into the interior of the cassette between the compression panel 38 and the end opening of the cassette 20. Typically, the compression panel 38 can be moved toward the bottom or opposite end from the open end, to provide access to the full capacity of the cassette 20. Once the notes 40 are loaded into the cassette 20 to the desired capacity, which may be the full capacity, the compression panel 38 is moved toward the open end and the closed door 30 to "pack" the notes and the door 28 is then slidingly moved upward toward the end opening proximate the door 30, this motion then locking the cassette 20 if a corresponding key mechanism is not available, otherwise the cassette 20 must be removed from the desktop station 16 to lock the cassette 20. The cassette 20 is then removed from the desktop station 16 and disposed on a transport mechanism for transport to the next station, the feeder station 12.
Referring now to FIG. 3, there is illustrated a perspective view of a sorting mechanism 41, which FIG. 3 does not illustrate the details of the sorting mechanism 41. However, the sorting mechanism 41 is operable to retrieve documents, such as notes, from a point 42 and deliver them to one of two points 44 or 46, only two delivery points noted for simplicity purposes. The sorting mechanism 41 is conventional and known by those skilled in the art.
The sorting mechanism 41 has a feeder docking station for feeding notes to the point 42 and two collection docking stations for receiving notes delivered to the points 44 and 46, respectively. When the cassette 20 is transported from the desktop station 16, after locking thereof, the cassette 20 is then disposed in the feeder docking station, which is comprised of a buffer region 48 and a docking region 50. The docking region 50 has associated therewith a key mechanism, similar to the key mechanism disposed under the door 22 in the desktop station 16 of FIG. 2. It is operable to be disposed in the docking region 50 and the key mechanism engaged, such that the door 28 can now be slidingly moved down toward the unopen end of the cassette 20 to expose all of the notes therein. The door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface to allow the notes 40 within the cassette 20 to be moved to the buffer region 48, the surface of the cassette 20, the surface of the door 30 and the lower surface of the buffer region 48 being coplanar.
It can be seen in the embodiment of FIG. 3 that there are a plurality of notes 54 that are disposed in the buffer region 48. These notes 54 are urged upward toward the point 42 with the use of a "paddle" 56. The paddle 56 is mounted on a feeding mechanism 58, which feeding mechanism 58 is operable to reciprocate the paddle along the length of the docking region 50 and buffer region 48. The paddle 56, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, is operable to be reciprocated upward and moved down into the unopen end of the cassette 20 and then pushed down into the cassette 20. It is only necessary for the paddle 56 to rise up high enough to clear the sides of the cassette 20.
In operation, the embodiment of FIG. 3 is illustrated wherein the notes 54 and the buffer region were previously fed in from prior cassette 20. The paddle 56 therefore had cleared the prior cassette and is fully within the buffer region 48, continually urging the notes 54 upward to the point 42. This urging of the notes 54 upward to the point 42 allows the sorting mechanism to strip the notes off. This stripping operation operates at approximately 1,500 notes per minute. When the new cassette 20 is disposed within the docking region 50, the operator in one embodiment then urges the notes 40 upward against the back surface of the paddle 56 and then moves the paddle 56 out of contact with the notes 54 in the buffer region 48 and then moves it vertically upward from the surface of the feeder station and then urges it downward along the length of the feeder station toward the closed end of the cassette 20 until it is proximate to the bottom of the notes 40. The paddle 56 is then engaged with the bottom of the notes 40, such that the notes 40 and the notes 54 now comprise one stack of notes. The paddle 56 then automatically urges the entire combined stack of notes 40 and 54 upward to the point 42. As soon as sufficient notes have been stripped off the top of the combined stack and the combined stack clears the cassette 20, the cassette 20 can be removed and another cassette provided. During this removal, the cassette 20 is allowed to remain open.
In the next operation, the operator will proceed to the next station, the collection station. In this mode, the cassette 20 is disposed within one of the collection docking stations. Each of the collection docking stations has a buffer region 60 and a docking region 62. The buffer region 60 is typically smaller than the buffer region 48, approximately six inches, but it has a similar key device as the feeder docking station in the event that a closed cassette is disposed therein. Once disposed in the docking region 62, the door 30 is then opened to provide a flat surface. A feeding mechanism 64 is provided that runs along the length of both buffer region 60 and docking region 62 and has a paddle 68 associated therewith. The paddle 68 is operable to reciprocate downward from the associated one of the points 44-46 as notes are fed therein and will move downward into the associated cassette 20. Once the sorter has determined that the capacity of the cassette 20 has been reached, i.e., the desired note count, it will discontinue routing notes to that particular collection location. The user will then remove the cassette 20, close the door 28 and then store the notes. Typically, there will be some type of bar code for identification purposes on a particular cassette which can be entered into a computer to provide some type of tracking ability. A reader could be implemented for automatically reading the bar code as the cassette is disposed on its associated feeder docking station, collection docking station, or desktop station.
Referring now to FIG. 4, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 in the open position. Each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed around the peripheral edges on the inner side thereof a slot 70 which is a guide slot for the door 28. An end cap 72 is provided to cover the locking mechanism (not shown) and has two groups of three key access holes 74 and 76. The end cap 72 covers the end portion of the door 28 also. However, one of its primary functions is to hide the key mechanism to prevent unlocking of the system and also to protect the locking mechanism.
Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, there are illustrated side views of the left and right sides 24 and 26, respectively. Each of the left and right sides 24 and 26 have associated therewith a rack 78 with a surface extending upward. Each of these racks 78 is operable to interface with a toothed gear 80, as shown in FIG. 4. The left side 24 has disposed below the rack 78 a horizontal slot 84 that runs along the length of the rack 78, whereas the right side 26 has disposed below the rack 78 a plurality of vertical slots 86. The horizontal slot 84 is a guide slot for the compression panel 38, whereas the vertical slots 86 are locking slots, as will be described hereinbelow. In addition, each of the sides 24 and 26 has disposed in the open end thereof a slot 90 and a slot 92, respectively, with each of the slots 90 and 92 having a detent 94 associated therewith. The detent 94 is operable to receive a pan head pin 96 on the right side of the door 30, the slot 90 operable to receive a similar pan head pin (not shown). The door 30, as will be described hereinbelow, is operable to reciprocate vertically in the closed position, such that the pin 96 can reciprocate downward into the detent 94. The left and right sides 24 and 26 are fabricated from a plastic material and the pan head pin 96 extends outward over the edge of the slot 90, it being a large diameter, such that it will prevent an individual from prying the sides 24 and 26 apart, gaining entrance thereto and then placing them back together. As will be described hereinbelow, when the door 28 is closed, it overlaps the door 30, preventing it from reciprocating upward and the pan head pin 96 rotating out of the slot 92.
Referring now to FIG. 7, there is illustrated an end view of the compression panel 38. The compression panel 38 is manufactured of a flat metal sheet having disposed on one side thereof a guide pin 100, proximate to the left side 24 and, on the other side thereof, a protrusion 102. The guide pin 100 is operable to be disposed within the guide slot 84 and the protrusion 102 is operable to fit within each of the slots 86 on the right side 26. The gears 80 are operable to be disposed within a slot 106 that has the rack 78 disposed therein and is proximate to the transparent window 32. Only the left side 24 is illustrated. The gears 80 are connected together through a shaft 108, the gears 80 fixedly attached to the shaft 108. In this manner, both gears 80 on either end of the shaft 108 are co-rotatable. The compression panel 38 is slidingly engaged with the shaft 108, such that it can slide in either direction and pivot about the shaft 108. A spring 110 is disposed between the edge of the compression panel 38 and the gear 80 proximate to the left side 24, such that the panel 38 is urged away from the guide slot 84.
In order to move the panel 38, the panel 38 is urged toward the slot 84, such that the guide pin 100 will be inserted in the slot 84. As this happens, the protrusion 102 is moved away from the right side 26 and the slots 86, thus allowing the panel 38 to be urged along the length of the cassette. When the panel 38 is at the appropriate position, the panel 38 is allowed to be moved away from the left side 24 and toward the right side 26 by the spring 110, such that the protrusion 102 will be inserted into one of the slots 86. Typically, this requires some manual manipulation.
The purpose for the fixed configuration of the shaft 108 and the two gears 80 is to prevent the panel 38 from skewing relative to a perpendicular orientation along the path of travel. Therefore, when the panel 38 is urged along the length of the cassette 20, both gears 80 must rotate and maintain a perpendicular orientation.
Referring now to FIG. 8, there is illustrated a detail of the open end showing the door 30 in an open position. The door 30 has associated with the left side a pan head pin 98 for interfacing with the slot 90. The door 30 is operable to rotate about hinges 112, which hinges 112 are asymmetrical, i.e., they are not round. This allows the door 30 to reciprocate in the planar surface thereof. This will allow the door 30 to reciprocate outward away from the pivoting area of the hinges 112, such that the narrow portion of the pan head pins 96 and 98 can insert in the slots 92 and 90, respectively, and then down into the detents 94. On the outermost edge of the door 30, there are provided two slots 114. The slots 114 are operable to interface with corresponding protrusions (not shown) on the docking station.
Referring now to FIG. 9, there is illustrated a side view of the door 30 in a closed position. The door 30 has a recess area 116 on the outer surface thereof which is operable to contain a handle 118. The handle 118 is operable to rotate about a pivot point 120 away from the recess area 116 and extend outward, as illustrated in FIG. 9. This allows the cassette 20 to be picked up. The pivot point 120 is disposed on a vertical protrusion 121 that extends outward from the door 30. A second protrusion 123 is also provided proximate to the end of the door 30 and having a lower height than the protrusion 121. The handle 118 has a pin 125 disposed thereon proximate to the pivot point 120 and slightly outward therefrom. The pin 125 is operable to fit within a recess 127 when the door 30 is closed. When the handle 118 is swung outward from the recess 116, the pin 125 contacts the upper surface of the recess 127 and forces the door 30 downward, such that the pin 98 is forced down into the detent 94. The two perpendicular protrusions 121 and 123 on the surface of the door 30 with the end of the door 28 (not shown) provide an overlap. The protrusions 121 and 123 prevent a would-be thief from slipping a note around the interface between the door 30 and the door 28.
Referring now to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a detail of the feeder docking station. At the feeder docking station, the cassette 20 is disposed in the cassette region 50 just below the buffer region 48. As noted above, the buffer region 48 is approximately equal to the length of the cassette region 50. The feeder mechanism 58 is comprised of a rod 130 that runs along the length of the feeder docking station. A reciprocating device 132 is disposed on the rod 130 and is attached to the paddle 56. The paddle 56 is operable to extend up over the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The reciprocating device 132 is interfaced with a chain 136, the chain constituting a part of the chain drive which is driven by a chain drive mechanism 138 on one end, the upper end, and a pulley mechanism 140 at the opposite end. The chain 136 moves in one direction. The reciprocating mechanism 132 has a release lever associated therewith (not shown) to allow it to be released. This is conventional in a sorter mechanism. Therefore, the reciprocating device 132 can be manually pulled down to a position beneath a group of notes 142.
As noted above, the cassette 20 is disposed in the feeder docking station after a previous cassette has been in the feeder docking station a sufficient amount of time for the paddle 56 to have been reciprocated upward and out of the cassette 20. When the new cassette 20 is disposed in the docking station, the end thereof is interfaced with a plurality of keys 146 that interface with the key slots 74 and 76. Once in the feeder docking station, the door 28 can be opened and door 30 then swiveled outward from the open end. At this point, the paddle 56 is at a location that is higher in the feeder docking station than the open end of the cassette 20. Since a typical cassette holds approximately 2,000 notes, there will be approximately 2,000 notes in the buffer region 48 when a cassette 20 is removed. At a feed rate of 1,500 notes per minute, it requires that a new cassette be disposed in the feeder docking station within less than approximately 1.5 minutes. Since the paddle 56 is reciprocating upward, the notes in the cassette 20 must be urged upward to contact the notes in the buffer region 50 and then the paddle 56 disposed behind the combined groups of notes. This can be done by two methods. In the first method, the user can push the notes in the buffer region upward to maintain a constant pressure thereon and then tilt the paddle 56 by rotating it after releasing it from the chain drive and then sliding it down the rod 130 to a point behind the notes in the cassette 20. The paddle 56 can then be utilized to slide the notes upward until they contact the notes in the buffer region 50, at which time the paddle 56 is then re-engaged with the chain drive. A second method is to urge the notes in the cassette upward from the cassette 20 to contact the back of the paddle 56, this being a manual operation. Thereafter, the user can hold these notes in place, rotate the paddle 56 upward and then place it behind the combined notes in the cassette and the ones previously in the buffer region 48. Thereafter, the operator waits for the notes to be urged completely out of the cassette 20 and then a new cassette placed in the feeder docking station. This is therefore a continuous and seamless operation to the sorter. In order to insure that the operation is continuous, the drive mechanism 138 provides a constant pressure on the notes. This is facilitated through the use of a pressure switch (not shown), which prevents too much pressure being placed on the notes with the paddle 56 or a direct drive motor. Either method is acceptable.
In order to facilitate removal of the cassette 20, a removal lever 150 is provided having an actuating arm 152. The actuating arm 152 is operable to be actuated and to cause the door 30 (not shown) to be urged upward, allowing the user to then complete door closing.
Referring now to FIG. 11, there is illustrated a perspective view of the cassette 20 disposed in the collection docking station. The collection docking station is substantially similar to the feeder docking station, with the exception that it operates in the reverse end that it does not have as large a buffer region. The buffer region is approximately 6 inches, less than the length of a cassette 20. In this mechanism, the paddle 68 is reciprocated along a rod (not shown) similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. A reciprocating block 154 is provided which is operable to reciprocate along this rod (not shown). The reciprocating block 154 is interfaced with an engaging member that contacts the side of a toothed belt 156, the toothed belt 156 being disposed on an idler pulley 158, that is toothed, and to a toothed drive pulley 160 on the other end. Drive pulley 160 is driven by a belt drive motor 164. The blade 68 is operable to reciprocate upward a sufficient vertical distance to clear notes 168 that are disposed in the collection docking station. The paddle 68 can then be disengaged with the belt 56 and reciprocated to a desired position.
The operation is such that notes, after the sorting operation, are routed to the particular collection docking station in which the cassette 20 resides and are, via gravity, disposed therein. The surface of the collection docking station is at approximately a forty five degree angle. When the paddle is reciprocated up to the closest position to the sorting mechanism, the notes will be disposed in the sorter and, in response to notes coming into the particular collection docking station, the belt drive motor 164 will increment the belt 156 and reciprocate the paddle 68 down toward the lower end of the collection docking station, which is also the closed end of the cassette 20, when the cassette 20 is disposed in the collection docking station. As will be described hereinbelow, there are sensors that sense when the paddle 68 approaches the cassette 20 and, a switch associated with the cassette 20 being in place will be sensed. If this switch is set, indicating a cassette 20 is disposed therein, the operation will continue and the blade 68 will move downward. Once a sufficient number of notes to fill the capacity of the cassette 20 have been disposed at a particular collection station, the paddle 68 will then be moved downward in the cassette 20, the paddle 68 reciprocated vertically upward and then moved all the way to the top, such that new notes coming into the collection docking station can then be disposed on the upper surface of the paddle 68. The cassette 20 can then have the door thereof closed, and then removed from the collection docking station. A new empty cassette is then disposed therein. Typically, as described above, the cassette 20 is already open. However, the locking keys (not shown) are disposed on the collection docking station to allow the cassette 20 be in an unlocked position and thereafter allow the door 28 to be slidingly moved upward for closure.
Referring now to FIG. 12, there is illustrated a side view of the paddle 68 and the reciprocating member 154. The paddle 68 has a lower flat surface 170, which contacts the notes 168. An extending arm 172 extends upward over the right side 24 of the cassette 20 and downward to a vertically reciprocating arm 174. The vertically reciprocating arm 174 reciprocates within a slide bracket 176. Slide bracket 176 is attached to the reciprocating member 154, reciprocating member 154 having a cylindrical bore 178 disposed therethrough that is operable to reciprocate along the rod that was not shown in FIG. 11 and that is similar to the rod 130 in FIG. 10. Below the reciprocating member 178 is disposed a toothed block 180, toothed block 180 shown in a side view and operable to interface with the teeth on the inside surface of the belt 156 on the outer band. Whenever it is desired to release the toothed block 180 from the belt 156, it is only necessary to pull up on the arm 172 which will rotate the toothed block 180 away from the surface of the belt 156.
Referring now to FIG. 13, there is illustrated a top view of the collection docking station with the cassette 20 removed. The collection docking station has a flat plate 182 with sides 184 and 186 associated therewith, these providing a guide for the cassette 20 on either side thereof A door 184 is provided, which is substantially identical to the door 22 on the desktop docking station 16 in FIG. 2. This door 184 covers the key members 146 described above with respect to FIG. 10 and is operable to open in response to the cassette 20 being placed therein. The purpose of the door 184, as described above, is for protection and, also for a visual view to require the user to place the cassette above the door and then slide it down to open the door and insert the keys. Otherwise, the user might try to push down upon the keys 146, thus damaging the keys 146. A switch orifice 190 is provided for containing a switch 192, which switch 192 indicates the presence of the cassette 20 when the door 30 is opened. The door 30 is operable to open into a space 194 which has a plate 196 disposed on the upper end thereof. This plate 196 is raised and has two projections 198 and 200 which are operable to interface with the slots 114 and the door 30, as illustrated in FIG. 8. Therefore, the door 30 can be laid flat such that a flat surface is presented. The release lever device 150, described above with respect to FIG. 10, is disposed on the upper left side of the cassette 20 when disposed therein. An extending lever member 204 extends outward in front of the cassette 20 when installed and under the edge of the door 30, substantially under the pan head pin 98. Therefore, it is only necessary to actuate the lever 152 to raise the lever member 204 and pull the door 30 upward to allow the user to grasp this lever.
A sensor 206 is provided in the side of the buffer region 60 which is operable to sense the presence of notes on the surface of the paddle 68. The paddle 68 is reciprocated all the way up to the sorter such that it is past the sensor 206. The sensor will indicate that there are no notes past that point. Once the notes have been collected to a certain thickness, the paddle 68 will reciprocate past the sensor 206 and the sensor 206 will provide a signal to a central control system. The central control system will then determine if the switch 192 is depressed, indicating the presence of a cassette. If not, then the system will be shut down only when the paddle is not in the buffer region. If it is in the buffer region, it will continue to operate.
Referring now to FIG. 14, there is illustrated a top view of the closed end 72 of the cassette 20, illustrating the locking mechanism. A first shaft 210 extends between the left side 24 and right side 26 and has associated therewith on one side two pivoting lever members 212 and 214. On the opposite side, proximate to the right side 26, are disposed two similar pivoting lever members 216 and 218. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are separated by a plastic bushing 220 attached to the shaft 210 with springs 222 and 224 disposed between the block 220 and pivoting lever members 212 and 214, respectively. Similarly, a plastic block 226 is disposed between pivoting lever members 216 and 218 and separated therefrom by springs 228 and 230. The pivoting lever members 212 and 214 are disposed above the outside key access holes 74 on the left side of the end 72 and the two pivoting members 216 and 218 are each disposed against opposite ones of the outside holes on the key access hole 76. The key members 146 are comprised of two outside key members 231 and 232 and a central key member 236. The outside key members 231 and 232 of the key portion associated with the key access holes 74 are operable to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, on the key member 146 associated with the key access hole 76, the outer key members 231 and 232 are operable to pass through the outside key access holes 76 to engage the ends of the pivoting lever members 216 and 218.
A second shaft 240 is provided that is disposed between the left side 24 and the right side 26 of the cassette 20. The shaft 240 is closer to the end 72. A pivoting lever 242 is disposed on the shaft 240 to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214. Similarly, a pivoting lever 244 is disposed on the shaft 240 and allowed to pivot thereabout and disposed between the distal ends of the pivoting lever member 216 and 218. Disposed on each side of the pivoting members 242 are tracks (not shown}. These tracks are operable to receive pins 246 that extend outward from the associated pivoting members 212 and 214, or 216 and 218. This will be described in more in detail with respect to FIG. 15. The pivoting lever members 242 are urged upward with the center key members 236 in each of the key devices 146. As will be described hereinbelow, when the pivoting lever 242 is urged upward, it is necessary for the pivoting action of the pivoting lever members 212 and 214, and 216 and 216 to traverse the path such that the pins 246 disposed in the ends and extending outward therefrom will traverse a particular path. Therefore, there is a defined shape to each of the members 231 and 232 which will determine this path.
Referring now to FIG. 15, there is illustrated a side view of a locking member looking into the side of the right side 26. There is provided a locking lever 250, which is pivoted on one end at a pivot point 252 and has a "crook" 254 on the other end thereof, this crook being at a distance from the pivot point 252, such that the crook 252 will pivot into the path 70. Whenever the door 28 slides through the guide 70 into the crook 254, the locking lever 250 rotated such that the crook 254 is in that path, this will prevent further movement. Additionally, once the door 28 is urged against the crook 254, the direction of forces is "normal" to the pivot point 252, such that the lever 250 is not stressed, the force being along the length thereof.
The lever member 244 extends outward from the shaft 240 and has a pivoting shaft 256 disposed thereon, which is pivoted about a hole in the distal end of the locking lever 250, distal from the pivoting point 252. Whenever the lever 244 is urged upward by the locking pin 234, the pivoting shaft 256 will be urged upward, pivoting the locking lever 250 about the pivot point 252 and moving the crook 254 away from the path 70, to thereby allow the door 28 to pass thereby.
The pivoting lever 244 has a track 260 formed in the side thereof that is operable to interface with the pin 246 in the lever 216. An opposite path is disposed on the opposite side to interface with the pin 246 in the pivoting lever 218. This path 260 is configured such that, as lever 244 pivots upward, the end of the pivoting lever 216 must pivot in such a manner that the pin 246 will meander along the correct path. If the shape of the key member 231 is not correct, the path will be wrong and it will fall into defined "pockets" which will prevent further movement and further pivoting of lever 244. The shape of both key members 231 and 232 must be correct in order to insure that the end of the pivoting members 216 and 218 traverse the defined path.
In summary, there has been provided a currency sorting system utilizing a cassette for transporting the currency between locations. The cassette is a secured device that has an interior with a door that can be opened to expose the entire front surface of the currency and an end that allows currency to be reciprocated out in a push operation. The cassette has a locking device for engaging with a corresponding key on a docking station, such that when the cassette is disposed on the docking station, the door will open. When removed from the docking station, and the door is closed, the door cannot be opened. The cassette is hand loaded at one docking station and then secured for movement to a second docking station that is associated with a sorting mechanism. On the sorting mechanism, it is necessary to feed the notes into the sorter input. The feeding docking station is approximately twice the length of the cassette with a cassette region and a buffer region. A paddle is utilized to extend downward into the cassette to urge the notes up into the buffer region. Once the notes are in the buffer region, the cassette can be removed and another cassette disposed therein and the paddle again moved into the cassette to urge the notes outward in a continuous motion. When the cassette is removed, it is then disposed in a third collection docking station in a collection slot. The collection slot is associated with a sorter output wherein notes that are sorted are disposed in particular ones of the collection docking stations. A paddle is provided in this station that reciprocates downward into the cassette as notes are disposed in that particular docking station. When the cassette is full, it can then be removed.
Although the preferred embodiment has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

(SECTION 14: SYSTEM GROUNDING) vii PREFACE The Handbook of Electric Power Calculations provides detailed step-by-step calculation procedures commonly encountered in electrical engineering. The Handbook contains a wide array of topics and each topic is written by an authority on the subject. The treatment throughout the Handbook is practical with very little emphasis on theory. Each of the 20 Sections follows this format: • Clear statement of the problem. • Step-by-step calculation procedure. • Inclusion of suitable graphs and illustrations to clarify the procedure. • Use of SI and USCS equivalents. This relatively simple, yet comprehensive format adds greatly to the use of the Handbook by the engineer or technician. Arithmetic and algebra are employed in the solution of the majority of the problems. Each section contains a list of references or a bibliography that is pertinent to the subject matter. This edition also includes a CD that has calculation procedures available for inclusion of other parameters, which will allow you to calculate problems with your specific numbers inserted. Grateful acknowledgment is given to each of the authors for their contribution to this 3rd edition of the Handbook. H. Wayne Beaty ix CONTENTS Section 1. Basic Network Analysis 1.1 Section 2.

Compute the current through and the voltage drop across each resistor in this circuit. 1.1 Calculation Procedure 1. Label the Circuit Label all the sections. Mark the direction of current through each resistor (Fig. 1.2). The equivalent resistance of the series-parallel combination of resistors can be found by successive applications of the rules for combining series resistors and parallel resistors. 2. Combine All Series Resistors In a series circuit, the total or equivalent resistance REQS seen by the source is equal to the sum of the values of the individual resistors: REQS R1 R2 R3     RN. Calculate the series equivalent of the elements connected in series in sections DE, CG, and GF: REQS (section DE) R13 R14 200 40 240  , REQS (section CG) R7 R8 200 400 600  , and REQS (section GF) R10 R11 400 200 600  . Replace the series elements included in sections DE, CG, and GF by their equivalent values (Fig. 1.3). 3. Combine All Parallel Resistors In the case of a parallel circuit of two unequal resistors in parallel, the total or equivalent resistance REQP can be found from the following product-over-sum equation: REQP R1 R2 R1R2/(R1 R2), where stands for in parallel with. The equivalent parallel resistance is always less than the smaller of the two resistors. In section CG, R5 R6 (1000   1500)/(1000 1500) 600  . Section CG now consists of two 600-  resistors in parallel. In a case of a circuit of N equal resistors in 1.2 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 1.1 A series-parallel dc circuit to be analyzed. 39495_01_p1.1-1.31 7/28/00 2: BASIC NETWORK ANALYSIS 1.3 FIGURE 1.2 Labeling the circuit of Fig. 1.1. FIGURE 1.3 Series elements replaced by their equivalent values. parallel, the total, or equivalent, resistance REQP can be determined from the following equation: REQP R/N, where R is the resistance of each of the parallel resistors and N is the number of resistors connected in parallel. For section CG, RCG 600/2 300 ; for section BC, RBC 100/3 331 /3 ; for section EF, REF 104/2 52 ; for section GF, RGF 600/2 300 . In a circuit of three or more unequal resistors in parallel, the total, or equivalent resistance REQP is equal to the inverse of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistance values: REQP 1/(1/R1 1/R2 1/R3     1/RN). The equivalent parallel resistance is always less than the smallest-value resistor in the parallel combination. Calculate the equivalent resistance of the elements connected in parallel in section DE: R15 R16 R17 1/(1/100 1/200 1/600) 60 . Calculate RDE : RDE 24060 (240)(60)/(240 60) 48 . Replace all parallel elements by their equivalent values (Fig. 1.4). 4. Combine the Remaining Resistances to Obtain the Total Equivalent Resistance Combine the equivalent series resistances of Fig. 1.4 to obtain the simple seriesparallel circuit of Fig. 1.5: RAB RBC RAC REQS 20 331 /3 531 /3 , RCG RGF RCF REQS 300 300 600 , RCD RDE REF RCF REQS 20 48 52 120 . Calculate the total equivalent resistance REQT: REQT 531 /3 (600 120) 1531 /3 . The final reduced circuit is illustrated in Fig. 1.6. 5. Compute the Total Line Current in Fig. 1.6 Using Ohm’s Law I1 E/REQT, where I1 total line current, E line voltage (power-supply voltage), and REQT line resistance or total equivalent resistance seen by power supply. Substituting values yields: I1 E/REQT 460/1531 /3 3 A. 1.4 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 1.4 Parallel elements replaced by their equivalent values. FIGURE 1.5 Circuit of Fig. 1.4 reduced to a simple series-parallel configuration. FIGURE 1.6 Final reduced circuit of Fig. 1.1. 39495_01_p1.1-1.31 7/28/00 2:03 PM Page 1.4 Copyright ( 6. Compute the Current Through, and the Voltage Drop Across, Each Resistor in the Circuit Refer to Figs. 1.2 and 1.4. Analysis of R1 yields: I1 3 A (calculated in Step 5); V1 VAB I1R1 (3)(20) 60 V; and for R2, R3, and R4 we have: VBC V2 V3 V4 I1RBC (3)(331 /3 ) 100 V. Current I2 I3 I4 100/100 1 A. Hence, VCF can be calculated: VCF E  (VAB VBC) 460  (60 100) 300 V. The current from C to G to F is 300/600 0.5 A. Kirchoff’s current law (KCL) states: The algebraic sum of the currents entering any node or junction of a circuit is equal to the algebraic sum of the currents leaving that node or junction:  I entering  I leaving. Applying KCL at node C, we find I12 3  0.5 2.5 A. Therefore, V12 VCD I12R12 (2.5)(20) 50 V. The voltage-divider principle states that the voltage VN across any resistor RN in a series circuit is equal to the product of the total applied voltage VT and RN divided by the sum of the series resistors, REQS: VN VT (RN/REQS). This equation shows that VN is directly proportional to RN and VCG VGF 300   (300/600) 150 V. Hence, I7 I8 150/600 0.25 A, V7 I7R7 (0.25)(200) 50 V, V8 I8R8 (0.25)(400) 100 V, I10 I11 150/600 0.25 A, V10 I10R10 (0.25)(400) 100 V, V11 I11R11 (0.25)(200) 50 V. The current-divider principle states that in a circuit containing N parallel branches, the current IN in a particular branch RN is equal to the product of the applied current IT and the equivalent resistance REQP of the parallel circuit divided by RN : IN IT (REQP /RN). When there are two resistors RA and RB in parallel, the current IA in RA is IA IT [RB /(/RA RB)]; the current IB in RB is IB IT[RA/(RA RB)]. When RA is equal to RB, IA IB IT /2. Refer to Figs. 1.2 , 1.3, and 1.4 for the remaining calculations: (R5 R6) R7 R8 600  . From the preceding equations, the value of the current entering the parallel combination of R5 and R6 is I5 I6 0.5/2 0.25 A. I5 0.25   (1500/2500) 0.15 A, and I6 0.25   (1000/2500) 0.10 A. Ohm’s law can be used to check the value of V5 and V6, which should equal VCG and which was previously calculated to equal 150 V: V5 I5R5 (0.15)(1000) 150 V and V6 I6R6 (0.10)(1500) 150 V. The current entering node G equals 0.5 A. Because R9 R10 R11, I9 I10 I11 0.5/2 0.25 A. From Ohm’s law: V9 I9R9 (0.25)(600) 150 V, V10 I10R10 (0.25)(400) 100 V, V11 I11R11 (0.25)(200) 50 V. These values check since VGF V9 150 V V10 V11 100 50 150 V. The remaining calculations show that: VDE I12RDE (2.5)(48) 120 V, I13 I14 120/240 0.5 A, V13 I13R13 (0.5)(200) 100 V, and V14 I14R14 (0.5)(40) 20 V. Since V15 V16 V17 VDE 120 V, I15 120/100 1.2 A, I16 120/200 0.6 A, and I17 120/600 0.2 A. These current values check, since I15 I16 I17 I13,14 1.2 0.6 0.2 0.5 2.5 A, which enters node D and which leaves node E. Because R18 R19, I18 I19 2.5/2 1.25 A and VEF V18 V19 (2.5)(52) 130 V. Kirchoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of the potential rises and drops around a closed loop or path is zero. This law can also be expressed as:  Vrises  Vdrops.

Any reducible dc circuit, that is, any circuit with a single power source that can be reduced to one equivalent resistance, no matter how complex, can be solved in a manner similar to the preceding procedure.

Use of this product is s BRANCH-CURRENT ANALYSIS OF A DC NETWORK Calculate the current through each of the resistors in the dc circuit of Fig. 1.7 using the branch-current method of solution. Calculation Procedure 1. Label the Circuit Label all the nodes (Fig. 1.8). There are four nodes in this circuit, indicated by the letters A, B, C, and D. A node is a junction where two or more current paths come together. A branch is a portion of a circuit consisting of one or more elements in series. Figure 1.8 contains three branches, each of which is a current path in the network. Branch ABC consists of the power supply E1 and R1 in series, branch ADC consists of the power supply E2 and R2 in series, and branch CA consists of R3 only. Assign a distinct current of arbitrary direction to each branch of the network (I1, I2, I3). Indicate the polarities of each resistor as determined by the assumed direction of current and the passive sign convention. The polarity of the power-supply terminals is fixed and is therefore not dependent on the assumed direction of current. 2. Apply KVL and KCL to the Network Apply KVL around each closed loop. A closed loop is any continuous connection of branches that allows us to trace a path which leaves a point in one direction and returns to that same starting point from another direction without leaving the network. Applying KVL to the minimum number of nodes that will include all the branch currents, one obtains: loop 1 (ABCA): 8 2I1 4I3 0; loop 2 (ADCA): 24 I2 4I3 0. KCL at node C:I1   I2 I3. 3. Solve the Equations The above three simultaneous equations can be solved by the elimination method or by using third-order determinants. The solution yields these results: I1 4 A, I2 8 A, and I3 4 A. The negative sign for I1 indicates that the actual current flows in the direction opposite to that assumed. Related Calculations. The above calculation procedure is an application of Kirchoff’s laws to an irreducible circuit. Such a circuit cannot be solved by the method used in the previous calculation procedure because it contains two power supplies. Once the branch currents are determined, all other quantities such as voltage and power can be calculated. 1.6 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 1.7 Circuit to be analyzed by branch currents. FIGURE 1.8 Labeling the circuit of Fig. 1.7. 39495_01_p1 MESH ANALYSIS OF A DC NETWORK Calculate the current through each of the resistors in the dc circuit of Fig. 1.9 using mesh analysis. Calculation Procedure 1. Assign Mesh or Loop Currents The term mesh is used because of the similarity in appearance between the closed loops of the network and a wire mesh fence. One can view the circuit as a “window frame” and the meshes as the “windows.” A mesh is a closed pathway with no other closed pathway within it. A loop is also a closed pathway, but a loop may have other closed pathways within it. Therefore, all meshes are loops, but all loops are not meshes. For example, the loop made by the closed path BCDAB (Fig. 1.9) is not a mesh because it contains two closed paths: BCAB and CDAC. Loop currents I1 and I2 are drawn in the clockwise direction in each window (Fig. 1.10). The loop current or mesh current is a fictitious current that enables us to obtain the actual branch currents more easily. The number of loop currents required is always equal to the number of windows of the network. This assures that the resulting equations are all independent. Loop currents may be drawn in any direction, but assigning a clockwise direction to all of them simplifies the process of writing equations. 2. Indicate the Polarities within Each Loop Identify polarities to agree with the assumed direction of the loop currents and the passive sign convention. The polarities across R3 are the opposite for each loop current. The polarities of E1 and E2 are unaffected by the direction of the loop currents passing through them. 3. Write KVL around Each Mesh Write KVL around each mesh in any direction. It is convenient to follow the same direction as the loop current: mesh I: 8  2I1  4(I1  I2) 0; mesh II: 24  4(I2  I1)  I2 0. 4. Solve the Equations Solving the two simultaneous equations gives the following results: I1 4 A and I2 8 A. The minus signs indicate that the two loop currents flow in a direction opposite to that assumed; that is, they both flow counterclockwise. Loop current I1 is therefore 4 A in the direction of CBAC. Loop current I2 is 8 A in the direction ADCA. The true BASIC NETWORK ANALYSIS 1.7 FIGURE 1.9 Circuit to be analyzed using mesh analysis. FIGURE 1.10 Labeling the circuit of Fig. 1.9. 39495 direction of loop current I2 through resistor R3 is from C to A. The true direction of loop current I1 through resistor R3 is from A to C. Therefore, the current through R3 equals (I2  I1) or 84 4 A in the direction of CA. Related Calculations. This procedure solved the same network as in Fig. 1.8. The mesh-analysis solution eliminates the need to substitute KCL into the equations derived by the application of KVL. The initial writing of the equations accomplishes the same result. Mesh analysis is therefore more frequently applied than branch-current analysis. However, it should be noted that mesh analysis can only be applied to planar circuits. NODAL ANALYSIS OF A DC NETWORK Calculate the current through each of the resistors in the dc circuit of Fig. 1.11 using nodal analysis. Calculation Procedure 1. Label the Circuit Label all nodes (Fig. 1.12). One of the nodes (node A) is chosen as the reference node. It can be thought of as a circuit ground, which is at zero voltage or ground potential. Nodes B and D are already known to be at the potential of the source voltages. The voltage at node C (VC) is unknown. Assume that VC VB and VC VD. Draw all three currents I1, I2, and I3 away from node C, that is, toward the reference node. 2. Write KCL at Node C I1 I2 I3 0. 3. Express Currents in Terms of Circuit Voltages Using Ohm’s Law Refer to Fig. 1.12: I1 V1/R1 (VC  8)/2, I2 V2 /R2 (VC  24)/1, and I3 V3 /R3 VC/4. 4. Substitute in KCL Equation of Step 2 Substituting the current equations obtained in Step 3 into KCL of Step 2, we find I1 I2 I3 0 or (VC  8)/2 (VC  24)/1 VC/4 0. Because the only unknown is VC , this simple equation can be solved to obtain VC 16 V. 1.8 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 1.11 Circuit to be analyzed by nodal analysis. FIGURE 1.12 Labeling the circuit of Fig. 1.11. 39495_01_p1.1-1.3 5. Solve for All Currents I1 (VC  8)/2 (16  8)/2 4 A (true direction) and I2 (VC  24)/1 (16  24)/1 8 A. The negative sign indicates that I2 flows toward node C instead of in the assumed direction (away from node C). I3 VC/4 16/4 4 A (true direction). Related Calculations. Nodal analysis is a very useful technique for solving networks. This procedure solved the same circuits as in Figs. 1.7 and 1.9. DIRECT-CURRENT NETWORK SOLUTION USING SUPERPOSITION THEOREM Calculate the value of the current through resistor R3 in the dc network of Fig. 1.13a using the superposition theorem. The superposition theorem states: In any linear network containing more than one source of electromotive force (emf) or current, the current through any branch is the algebraic sum of the currents produced by each source acting independently. Calculation Procedure 1. Consider the Effect of EA Alone (Fig. 1.13b) Because EB has no internal resistance, the EB source is replaced by a short circuit. (A current source, if present, is replaced by an open circuit.) Therefore, RTA 100 (100 100) 150   and ITA EA/RTA 30/150 200 mA. From the current-divider rule, I3A 200 mA/2 100 mA. 2. Consider the Effect of EB Alone (Fig. 1.13c) Because EA has no internal resistance, the EA source is replaced by a short circuit. Therefore, RTB 100 (100 100) 150   and ITB EB/RTB 15/150 100 mA. From the current-divider rule, I3B 100 mA/2 50 mA. BASIC NETWORK ANALYSIS 1.9 FIGURE 1.13 Application of the superposition theorem: (a) current in R3 to be determined; (b) effect of EA alone; and (c) effect of EB alone. 39495_01_p1.1-1.31 7/28/00 3. Calculate the Value of I3 The algebraic sum of the component currents I3A and I3B is used to obtain the true magnitude and direction of I3: I3 I3A  I3B 100  50 50 mA (in the direction of I3A). Related Calculations. The superposition theorem simplifies the analysis of a linear network only having more than one source of emf. This theorem may also be applied in a network containing both dc and ac sources of emf. This is considered later in the section. DIRECT-CURRENT NETWORK SOLUTION USING THEVENIN’S THEOREM Calculate the value of the current IL through the resistor RL in the dc network of Fig. 1.14a using Thevenin’s theorem. Thevenin’s theorem states: Any two-terminal linear network containing resistances and sources of emf and current may be replaced by a single source of emf in series with a single resistance. The emf of the single source of emf, called ETh, is the open-circuit emf at the network terminal. The single-series resistance, called RTh, is the resistance between the network terminals when all of the independent sources are replaced by their internal resistances. Calculation Procedure 1. Calculate the Thevenin Voltage (Fig. 1.14b) When the Thevenin equivalent circuit is determined for a network, the process is known as “thevenizing” the circuit. 1.10 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 1.14 Application of Thevenin’s theorem: (a) current IL to be determined; (b) calculating ETh; (c) calculating RTh; and (d) resultant Thevenin equivalent circuit. 394 The load resistor is removed as shown in Fig. 1.14b. The open-circuit terminal voltage of the network is calculated; this value is ETh. Because no current can flow through R3, the voltage ETh (VAB) is the same as the voltage across resistor R2. Use the voltage-divider rule to find ETh: ETh (100 V)   [100/(100 100)] 50 V. 2. Calculate the Thevenin Resistance (Fig. 1.14c) The network is redrawn with the source of emf replaced by a short circuit. (If a current source is present, it is replaced by an open circuit.) The resistance of the redrawn network as seen by looking back into the network from the load terminals is calculated. This value is RTh, where RTh 50   (100  )(100  ) 100  . 3. Draw the Thevenin Equivalent Circuit (Fig. 1.14d) The Thevenin equivalent circuit consists of the series combination of ETh and RTh. The load resistor RL is connected across the output terminals of this equivalent circuit. RT RTh RL 100 50 150  , and IL ETh/RT 50/150 1 /3 A. Related Calculations. With respect to the terminals only, the Thevenin circuit is equivalent to the original linear network. Changes in RL do not require any calculations for a new Thevenin circuit. The simple series Thevenin circuit of Fig. 1.14d can be used to solve for load currents each time RL is changed. The Thevenin theorem is also applicable to networks with dependent sources. Additionally, node-voltage analysis and meshcurrent analysis may be applied to determine VTh. In rare cases, with only dependent sources present, one may have to assume a fictitious 1 A or 1V “injection” source at the terminals. DIRECT-CURRENT NETWORK SOLUTION USING NORTON’S THEOREM Calculate the value of the current IL through the resistor RL in the dc network of Fig. 1.15a using Norton’s theorem. BASIC NETWORK ANALYSIS 1.11 FIGURE 1.15 Application of Norton’s theorem: (a) current IL to be determined; (b) calculating RN; (c) calculating IN; and (d) resultant Norton equivalent circuit. 39495_01_p1.1-1 Norton’s theorem states: Any two-terminal linear dc network can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a constant-current source IN in parallel with a resistor RN. Calculation Procedure 1. Calculate the Norton Parallel Resistance, RN (Fig. 1.15b) The load resistor is removed (Fig. 1.15b). All sources are set to zero (current sources are replaced by open circuits, and voltage sources are replaced by short circuits). RN is calculated as the resistance of the redrawn network as seen by looking back into the network from the load terminals A and B: RN 50   (100   100  ) 100  . A comparison of Figs. 1.14c and 1.15b shows that RN RTh. 2. Calculate the Norton Constant-Current Source, IN (Fig. 15c) IN is the short-circuit current between terminals A and B. RT 100   (100   50  ) 1331 /3  and IT E/RT (100/1331 /3 ) 3 /4 A. From the current-divider rule: IN ( 3 /4 A) (100)/(100 50) 0.5 A. 3. Draw the Norton Equivalent Circuit (Fig. 1.15d) The Norton equivalent circuit consists of the parallel combination of IN and RN. The load resistor RL is connected across the output terminals of this equivalent circuit. From the current-divider rule: IL (0.5 A)[100/(100 50)] 1 /3 A. Related Calculations. This problem solved the same circuit as in Fig. 1.14a. It is often convenient or necessary to have a voltage source (Thevenin equivalent) rather than a current source (Norton equivalent) or a current source rather than a voltage source. Figure 1.16 shows the source conversion equations which indicate that a Thevenin equivalent circuit can be replaced by a Norton equivalent circuit, and vice versa, provided that the following equations are used: RN RTh; ETh INRTh INRN, and IN ETh /RN ETh /RTh. The conversion between Thevenin and Norton equivalents is generally known as a source transformation. BALANCED DC BRIDGE NETWORK Calculate the value of Rx in the balanced dc bridge network of Fig. 1.17. 1.12 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 1.16 Source conversion equations. 39495_01_p1.1-1.31 7/28 Calculation Procedure 1. Solve for Rx The bridge network is balanced when R3 is adjusted so that VA VB. Then: R1/R2 R3/Rx. Solving for Rx, we find Rx R2R3/R1 (20)(2)/10 4 k . Related Calculations. This network topology is classically known as a Wheatstone Bridge and is used to precisely measure resistances of medium values in the range of 1 ohm to 1 mega-ohm. There is a potential drop across terminals A and B when the bridge is not balanced, causing current to flow through any element connected to those terminals. Mesh analysis, nodal analysis, Thevenin’s theorem, or Norton’s theorem may be used to solve the unbalanced network for voltages and currents. Using the same topology of the circuit (Fig. 1.17), but replacing the dc source with an ac source and the four resistors with properly biased diodes, one obtains a simple rectifier circuit for converting ac input to a unidirectional output. UNBALANCED DC BRIDGE NETWORK Calculate the value of REQT in the unbalanced dc bridge network of Fig. 1.18. Calculation Procedure 1. Convert the Upper Delta to an Equivalent Wye Circuit Delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta conversion formulas apply to Fig. 1.19. The formulas for delta-to-wye conversion are: R1 RARC/(RA RB RC), R2 RBRC/(RA RB BASIC NETWORK ANALYSIS 1.13 FIGURE 1.17 Analysis of a balanced dc bridge. 39495_01_p1 RC), and R3 RBRA/(RA RB RC). The formulas for wye-to-delta conversion are: RA (R1R2 R1R3 R2R3)/R2, RB (R1R2 R1R3 R2R3/R1), and RC (R1R2 R1R3 R2R3)/R3. The upper delta of Fig. 1.18 is converted to its equivalent wye by the conversion formulas (see Fig. 1.20): R1 [(30)(60)]/(30 50 60) 12.9  , R2 [(50)(60)]/(30 50 60) 21.4  , and R3 [(50)(30)]/(30 50 60) 10.7  . From the simplified series-parallel circuit of Fig. 1.20b, it can be seen that: REQT 10.7 [(12.9 40) (21.4 20)] 33.9  . Related Calculations. Delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta conversion is used to reduce the series-parallel equivalent circuits, thus eliminating the need to apply mesh or nodal analysis. The wye and delta configurations often appear as shown in Fig. 1.21. They are then referred to as a tee (T) or a pi ( ) network.

ANALYSIS OF A SQUARE WAVE Find the average and rms values of the square wave of Fig. 1.22. Calculation Procedure 1. Calculate the Average Value The average value, or dc component, of the symmetrical square wave is zero; therefore: Vdc Vavg 0. 2. Calculate the rms Value The rms value is found by squaring the wave over a period of 2 s. This gives a value equal to 100 V2 , which is a constant value over the entire period. Thus, the mean over the period is V2 . The square root of 100 V2 equals 10 V. Therefore, the rms value is V 10 V. 1.16 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 1.22 Square wave to be analyzed. 39495_01_p1 Related Calculations.

The dc network theorems used in previous problems can be applied to ac networks except that vector algebra must be used for the ac quantities. ANALYSIS OF POWER IN AN AC CIRCUIT Find the total watts, total VARS, and total volt-amperes in the ac circuit of Fig. 1.29a. Recall that watts, VARS, and volt-amperes are all dimensionally the same, that is, the product of voltage and current. However, we use the designators of watts (W) to represent real power (instantaneous or average), volt-amperes-reactive (VARS) to represent reactive power, and volt-amperes (VA) to represent complex (or apparent) power. Calculation Procedure 1. Study the Power Triangle Figure 1.30 shows power triangles for ac circuits. Power triangles are drawn following the standard of drawing inductive reactive power in the j direction and capacitive reactive power in thej direction. Two equations are obtained by applying the Pythagorean theorem to these power triangles: S2 P2 and S2 P2 . These equations can be applied to series, parallel, or series-parallel circuits. The net reactive power supplied by the source to an RLC circuit is the difference between the positive inductive reactive power and the negative capacitive reactive power: QX QL  QC, where QX is the net reactive power, in VARS. 2.

RESPONSE OF AN INTEGRATOR TO A RECTANGULAR PULSE A single 10-V pulse with a width of 100  s is applied to the RC integrator of Fig. 1.37. Calculate the voltage to which the capacitor charges. How long will it take the capacitor to discharge (neglect the resistance of the pulse source)? Calculation Procedure 1. Calculate the Voltage to Which the Capacitor Charges The rate at which a capacitor charges or discharges is determined by the time constant of the circuit. The time constant of a series RC circuit is the time interval that equals the product of R and C. The symbol for time constant is   (Greek letter tau):   RC, where R is in ohms, C is in farads, and   is in seconds. The time constant of this circuit is:   RC (100 k )(0.001  F) 100  s. Because the pulse width equals 200  s (2 time constants), the capacitor will charge to 86 percent of its full charge, or to a voltage of 8.6 V. The expression for RC charging is: vC(t) VF(1  e t/RC), where VF is the final value. In this case the final value, VF 10 V, would be reached if the pulse had a width of 5 or more time constants. See the RC time constant charging table (Table 1.1). 2. Calculate the Discharge Time The capacitor discharges back through the source at the end of 200  s. The total discharge time for practical purposes is 5 time constants or (5)(100  s) 500  s. The expression for RC discharging is: vC(t) Vt (et/RC), where Vi is the initial value.

Choose the appropriate voltmeter and potential transformer for making the measurement. Calculation Procedure 1. Select Voltmeter Self-contained ac voltmeters with scales ranging from 150 to 750 V are available. Where higher voltages are to be measured, a potential transformer is required to produce a voltage suitable for indication on a meter with 150-V full-scale indication. A 150-V meter is therefore selected. 2. Select Potential Transformer By dividing the line-to-line voltage by the voltmeter full-scale voltage, one obtains an approximate value of transformer ratio: 4160 V/150 V 27.7. Select the next higher standard value, 40:1. To check the selection, calculate the secondary voltage with the potential transformer: 4160 V/40 104 V. 2.1 2.2 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS 3. Connect Transformer and Voltmeter to the Line The potential transformer and voltmeter are connected to the three-phase line, as shown in Fig. 2.1. Precautions Any leakage in the insulation between windings in potential transformer can cause high voltage to appear on low voltage side. Related Calculations. Instruments used for measuring electrical quantities in utility or industrial service, such as voltmeters, ammeters, and wattmeters, are referred to as switchboard instruments. Instruments used for measurement of nonelectrical quantities, such as pressure, temperature, and flow rate, involve more complex techniques that include a sensor, transmission line, and receiver or indicator. In these systems, the receiver may also perform a recording function. Very often, the instrumentation system is part of a process-control system. In such cases, the instrument that receives and indicates also serves as a controller. These industrial measurement systems may involve pneumatic, electrical analog (voltage or current), or electrical digital signal-transmission techniques. Question Describe a system for monitoring the voltage of a power system digitally (Fig. 2.2). Assume that up to the 11th harmonic is of interest, and that the analog-to-digital converter has a range of 0 to 5 V. Calculation Procedure A potential transformer (PT) will step down the voltage of the power system to a value compatible to digital and analog electronic systems. In this case, a standard PT is used to step down the voltage to 10 V peak-to-peak. The value of the PT output has to be made compatible with the range of the A/D converter. We assume the PT produces a maximum of 5 V peak (or 10 V peak-to-peak). An op-amp summer circuit is then connected, such that the voltage remains compatible with the analog-to-digital converter at all times. The summer should step down the input by half and add a reference of 2.5. This will keep the input of the A/D converter within 0 to 5 V at all times. The following values in the op-amp summer circuit satisfy the preceding requirements: Ri 20 K An antialiasing filter is used such that the cutoff frequency is equal to half the Rref 10 K Rf 10 K FIGURE 2.1 Voltmeter connections to a threephase power line. INSTRUMENTATION 2.3 sampling frequency of the A/D converter. Since the 11th harmonic is of interest to the digital monitoring system, the sampling frequency should equal at least twice the 11th harmonic. 2 11 60 1320 samples per second The RC filter shown has a cutoff frequency of 1/2 pi RaC, which should equal 11 60 660 Hz. If Ra is chosen as 10 K, C 2.411 E-8 farad. If R is too small, it may overload the op-amp. If R is too large, the output may be noisy. The value of R is also determined by the availability of capacitors. Lastly, the negative voltage is reconverted to positive by using an inverter circuit. The A/D converter will now give a 12-bit digital value for the voltage 1320 times per second. CURRENT MEASUREMENT Current is to be measured in a single-phase line that supplies a 240-V, 20-kW load with a 0.8 power factor (pf). Select an appropriate ammeter and current transformer. Describe the limitations of the current transformer under short-circuit conditions. Describe the applicability of fiber-optic transducers. Calculation Procedure 1. Select Ammeter Direct-reading ammeters are available with full-scale readings ranging from 2 to 20 A. Measurement of larger currents requires the use of a current transformer. Standard practice is to use a 5-A full-scale ammeter with the appropriate current transformer. Ammeters so used are calibrated in accordance with the selected transformer. 12-bit A/D Converter 0–5 V Range 5 K Rf 10 K Power Line P.T. 10 V peakpeak  2 5 Ri 20 K Rref 10 K 10 K OP-AMP SUMMER CIRCUIT 5 K C 24.11 10 9 f Ra 10 K         FIGURE 2.2 Digitally monitoring the voltage of a power system. 2.4 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS 2. Calculate Current I P(V pf) 20,000/(240 0.8) 104 A. 3. Select Current Transformer Because the current is greater than 20 A, a current transformer is required. A transformer is chosen that can accommodate a somewhat higher current; a 150:5 current transformer is therefore selected. The ammeter is a 5-A meter with its scale calibrated from 0 to 150 A. 4. Connect Ammeter and Transformer to Line The ammeter is connected to the line, through the current transformer, as in Fig. 2.3. Precautions The secondary of the transformer is to be closed at all times. Otherwise, the operator side would step-up the voltage and a dangerous voltage may be generated. Limitations Under short-circuit conditions, the large currents may saturate the core and distort the output waveform. The core may also be unable to accurately respond to the rapid transients associated with short circuits. Optical Transducers Recently, there has been some progress in using optical transducers to replace current transformers. This is based on the principle of measuring the magnetic field in the vicinity of the current-carrying conductor. Advantages include that the fiber-optic transmission of such signals is immune to noise and that such transducers are very compact devices. The sensors also isolate the measurement devices from the high-tension side. POWER MEASUREMENT USING A SINGLE-PHASE WATTMETER The power consumption of a load, estimated to be 100 kVA, is to be measured. If the load is supplied by a 2400-V single-phase line, select a suitable wattmeter to make the measurement. Calculation Procedure 1. Select Wattmeter Single-phase, as well as three-phase, wattmeters often require current and/or potential transformers as accessories. Wattmeters are generally designed for 120- or 480-V operation with a maximum current rating of 5 A. For this application, a 120-V, 5-A wattmeter is selected. FIGURE 2.3 Ammeter connections to a singlephase power line. INSTRUMENTATION 2.5 2. Select Current Transformer The line current is 100,000/2400 41 A. A current transformer is therefore required; a 50:5-A rating is suitable. 3. Select Potential Transformer The line voltage of 2400 V is required to be stepped down to 120V. A 20:1 potential transformer is chosen. 4. Connect Wattmeter and Transformers to Line The wattmeter and both transformers are connected to the 2400-V line as indicated in Fig. 2.4. POWER MEASUREMENT USING A THREE-PHASE WATTMETER The power consumption of a load, estimated to be 1500 kVA, is to be measured. The load is supplied by a three-phase, three-wire line, 12,000-V line-to-line. Specify a suitable wattmeter for the measurement. Calculation Procedure 1. Select Wattmeter Three-phase wattmeters intended for use with three-wire, three-phase lines are available, as well as others intended for use with four-wire, three-phase lines. For this application, a 120-V, 5-A, three-wire wattmeter is a good choice. 2. Select Current Transformer The line current is 1,500,000/(1.73 12,000) 72 A. A current transformer with a 100:5-A ratio is chosen. 3. Select Potential Transformer The line-to-line voltage of 12,000 V requires that a 12,000/120, or 100:1, potential transformer be used. 4. Connect Wattmeter and Transformers to Line The wattmeter and both transformers are connected to the three-wire line, as shown in Fig. 2.5. FIGURE 2.4 Single-phase wattmeter circuit. FIGURE 2.5 Three-phase, three-wire wattmeter circuit. 2.6 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS POWER MEASUREMENT ON A FOUR-WIRE LINE A 500-kVA load is supplied by a three-phase, four-wire, 4160-V line. Select a suitable wattmeter for measuring power consumption. Calculation Procedure 1. Select Wattmeter A four-wire type having a 120-V, 5-A rating is chosen. 2. Select Current Transformer The line current is 500,000/(1.73 4160) 72 A. Therefore, a 75:5-A ratio is chosen for each of the current transformers. 3. Select Potential Transformer The line-to-neutral voltage is 4160/1.73 2400 V. Therefore, a 20:1 ratio is selected for the two potential transformers. 4. Connect the Wattmeter and Transformers to the Lines The wattmeter and transformers are connected to the 4160-V, three-phase, four-wire line, as in Fig. 2.6. REACTIVE-POWER MEASUREMENT A varmeter is used to measure the reactive power in an industrial plant that is supplied by an 8300-V, three-phase, four-wire line. The plant load is estimated to be 300 kVA at 0.8 pf. Design a suitable measuring system. FIGURE 2.6 Three-phase, four-wire wattmeter circuit. INSTRUMENTATION 2.7 FIGURE 2.7 Varmeter connected to a threephase, four-wire power line. Calculation Procedure 1. Select Varmeter The high-line voltage and large load dictate the use of a three-phase varmeter (rated at 120 V, 5 A) with current and potential transformers. 2. Select Current Transformer Iline 300,000/(1.73 8300) 20.8 A. A 25:5-A current transformer is selected. 3. Select Potential Transformer The potential transformer used with a three-phase, four-wire varmeter is connected line-to-neutral. The line-to-neutral voltage is 8300/1.73 4790 V; 4790/120 39.9. A 40:1 potential transformer is selected. 4. Determine a Suitable Scale for Meter The phase angle  is equal to cos–1 0.8 36.9°. The reactive power 300,000 sin 36.9° 300,000 0.6 180,000 VARS. A scale providing a maximum reading of 200,000 VARS is selected. 5. Connect Varmeter to Line The varmeter is connected to the power line by means of the current and potential transformers, as illustrated in Fig. 2.7. Related Calculations. Varmeters are made for single- and three-phase, three- and fourwire systems. Center-zero scales are generally used for a varmeter. The instrument is designed to deflect to the right for a lagging power factor and to the left for a leading power factor. Many varmeters require an external compensator or phase-shifting transformer. For high-voltage systems with large loads, it is common practice to use current and potential transformers with varmeters designed for 120-V, 5-A operation. POWER-FACTOR MEASUREMENT The power factor of a group of four 30-hp electric motors in a manufacturing plant is to be measured. The motors are supplied by a 480/277-V, three-phase, three-wire line. The load is estimated to be 160 kVA, 0.85 pf. Determine how the power factor is to be measured. 2.8 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS Calculation Procedure 1. Select a Suitable Power-Factor Meter A three-phase, three-wire power-factor meter is chosen for this application. Although self-contained power-factor meters are available, this application requires the use of current and potential transformers. 2. Select Current Transformer Iline 160,000/(1.73 480) 192 A. Select a 200:5-A current transformer. 3. Select Potential Transformer For this meter, the potential-transformer primary winding is connected line-to-line. The potential transformer ratio, therefore, is 480/120 4:1. A 4:1 potential transformer is chosen. 4. Connect Power-Factor Meter-to-Line Figure 2.8 shows how the current and potential tansformers are connected to the meter and line. Related Calculations. Power-factor meters are made for single-phase as well as threephase systems. Polyphase power-factor meters are designed on the basis of balanced loads. Calculation Procedure 1. Select a Suitable Meter For this application, a 240-V, three-wire, single-phase wattmeter without a demand register is selected. The meter is capable of carrying 200 A, which is the smallest current rating available. Neither current nor voltage instrument transformers are required for this application. 2. Connect the Watthour Meter to Line A meter socket, or pan, is commonly used as a means of mounting the meter as well as connecting it to the line. The connection to the meter socket, and the internal connections of the meter, are provided in Fig. 2.9. Related Calculations. Watthour meters are available for single- and three-phase loads, with clock-type and cyclometer (digital) readouts, with and without demand registers (Fig. 2.10). The single-phase, three-wire watthour meter contains two current coils and one potential coil. These act as the stator windings of a two-phase induction motor having a solid aluminum disk as its rotor. FIGURE 2.8 Power-factor meter connected to a three-phase, three-wire power line. INSTRUMENTATION 2.9 ELECTRIC PEAK-POWER DEMAND METERING It is necessary to measure the peak demand, on a 15-min basis, of an industrial plant for which the peak demand is estimated to be 150 kW. The plant is supplied by a three-phase, four-wire, 7200-V line. The power factor is estimated to be 0.8 at peak demand. Specify how the measurement is to be made. Calculation Procedure 1. Select Demand Meter This application calls for a three-phase, four-wire meter containing a demand register with 15-min time intervals. The application requires use of both current and potential transformers. 2. Select Current Transformer Iline 150,000/(1.73 7200 0.8) 15.1 A. Select a 15:5-A current transformer with a 15,000-V insulation rating. 3. Select Potential Transformer The primary windings of these transformers are connected line-to-line and are therefore subject to 7200 V. The secondary winding provides 120 V to the meter. A transformer having a 7200:120, or 60:1, ratio is called for. An insulation rating of 15,000 V is required. 4. Connect Meter to Line The meter connected to the line is shown in Fig. 2.11. Related Calculations. Demand meters are incorporated into watthour meters for many commercial, institutional, and industrial plants that are subject to demand FIGURE 2.9 Single-phase watthour meter connections. FIGURE 2.10 Three-phase, three-wire watthour meter connections. 2.10 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS charges by the electric utility. Demand meters operate as watthour meters over specified time intervals, usually 15- or 30-min periods. The highest 15- or 30-min consumption of energy is retained as an indication on the demand register until it is manually reset to zero. This is usually done on a monthly basis. The calibration of the demand register is in kilowatts and takes into account the period during which energy consumption is accumulated. The selection of a demand meter is similar to the selection of a watthour meter. It is based on the type of service (single- or three-phase), the line voltage, anticipated current, and the time interval over which the definition of peak demand is based. TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT The temperature of the cylinder head in a diesel engine is to be remotely indicated at a control-room panel. A temperature range of 0 to 200°C is to be accommodated. Design a system for making the measurement. Calculation Procedure 1. Select System Type Pneumatic and electrical analog systems are used for transmission of nonelectrical quantities. Availability of air supply and environmental and maintenance factors govern the choice of system. In this application, an electrical system is chosen. FIGURE 2.11 Connecting a three-phase watthour meter with a demand register to a power line. INSTRUMENTATION 2.11 FIGURE 2.12 Temperature-measurement instrumentation. 2. Select Sensor A copper-Constantan (type T) thermocouple is selected because of its small size, flexibility, and suitability for the temperature range to be measured. 3. Select Transmitter Industrial instrumentation systems involve use of electronic or pneumatic instruments, called transmitters, to convert the weak signal produced by the sensor to a standard form. In electrical analog systems, this is usually a direct current, ranging from 4 to 20 mA. Transmitters are always used with receivers, or indicators, from which power is derived. A two-wire transmitter requires only two conductors to be run from transmitter to receiver. In this case a two-wire millivolt-to-current transmitter is selected. The particular model is designed to accept the output of a type T thermocouple over a temperature range of 0 to 200°C (approximately 0 to 10mV). The minimum temperature corresponds to 4mA of output current while the maximum temperature corresponds to 20mA of output current. 4. Select Indicator Indicators, or receivers, for electrical analog instrumentation systems are designed to accommodate 4 to 20mA dc. Calibrations may show 0 to 100 percent or the actual temperature. Recording indicators are used where automatic recording is required. Pointertype instruments are traditional but digital displays are now available. In this case, a nonrecording pointer-type instrument, with the temperature scale shown on the face of the instrument, is selected. 5. Connect System Components The connections between thermocouple, transmitter, and indicator are illustrated in Fig. 2.12. Related Calculations. Temperature-dependent resistors (TDRs), thermocouples, thermistors, and semiconductor sensors are used for industrial temperature measurement. The temperature range to be accommodated, ease of installation, and environmental factors affect the selection. Question Describe a system to monitor the temperature of a power component digitally, using a temperature-dependent current-source-type transducer (Fig. 2.13). The transducer is to give 1  A per K, and the system should have a range of 0–100°C. The A/D converter has a range 0–5 V. 2.12 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS Calculation Procedure Commercial transducers of this type may operate with any supply between 5 and 15 V. Assuming the diode can accept source voltages of this range, the current should be dependent on temperature only. A resistance is placed so that a measurable voltage is obtained. 10K is chosen, as it will generate a voltage of appropriate magnitude. 0°C will produce 2.73 V and 100°C will produce 3.73 V. These will determine the values for the summing amplifier. We now use the relationship for the summer, [I1/R1   I2/R2]Rf  Vout For the given conditions, the following resistances and reference voltage are satisfactory: R1 16.4K The op-amp buffer is placed so as not to load the transducer. The inverter ensures that the voltage is positive at all times. The A/D converter will now give full output for 100°C and zero output for 0°C. PRESSURE MEASUREMENT The pressure in a retort of a chemical processing plant is to be remotely indicated and recorded. The corrosive and toxic nature of the liquid requires isolation of the pressuresensing instrument. There is no air supply available for instrumentation purposes. The pressure to be measured is usually between 414 and 552 kPa (60 and 80 psi) but can vary from 0 to 690 kPa (0 to 100psi). Design a remote-measuring system.

R2 10K Rf 10K INSTRUMENTATION 2.13 FIGURE 2.14 Pressure instrumentation system. Calculation Procedure 1. Select Suitable System The lack of an air supply is a major factor in choosing an electrical analog system. A pressure-to-current transmitter equipped with an isolation diaphragm and capillary tube is required to avoid contact with the hazardous material within the retort. The transmitter is a two-wire transmitter with an output of 4 to 20 mA corresponding to pressures ranging from 0 to 690 kPa (0 to 100 psi). The other major component of the system is the indicator–recorder, which is located in the control room. 2. Connect and Install System The pressure-to-current transmitter is located at the retort and connected to an isolating diaphragm, as shown in Fig. 2.14. The capillary tube connecting the diaphragm to the transmitter may be prefilled by the instrument manufacturer or may be filled at the site during installation. Care must be exercised to avoid the inclusion of the air bubbles, which renders the system unduly temperature-sensitive. A two-wire cable connects the transmitter to the indicator–recorder, located in the control room. This instrument contains the necessary dc power supply and associated electronic circuitry, deriving power from the 120-V, 60-Hz power line. Related Calculations. Remote indication of pressure is usually accomplished by means of a pressure sensor coupled to a transmitter, which is connected by electrical conductors or pneumatic tubing to a remote indicating instrument. Typically, the systems are either pneumatic, with 20.7 to 103.4 kPa (3 to 15 psi) representing the full span of pressures to be measured, or electrical analog, with 4 to 20 mA dc representing the full span of pressures to be measured. Electrical analog systems use either two- or four-wire transmitters to convert the sensed pressure to an electrical current. Question Describe the instrumentation needed for monitoring incipient failures in 12-kV transformers and line insulators (Fig. 2.15). Calculation Procedure Insulation breakdown in transformers and insulators is often preceded by random low magnitudes of high-frequency currents (100s or 1000s of kHz). Since CTs may be unable 2.14 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS to respond to transients of these frequencies, a series resistance in the line may be used when appropriate. The voltage across the resistor can be monitored in real-time, or it can be recorded for processing later. Failing insulation also gives off electromagnetic interference, which is picked up by appropriate detectors or simply by an AM radio. An infrared detector may also be used to pick up the heat energy given off by failing insulation. Gas chromatography has been used successfully to detect the gases created in the oils of failing transformers. BIBLIOGRAPHY Anderson, P. M. 1999. Power System Protection. New York: McGraw-Hill.

Find the speed calibration for a voltmeter of very high impedance connected to the armature circuit. 3.1 Calculation Procedure 1. Determine the Number of Paths in the Armature Circuit For a lap winding, the number of paths (in parallel), a, is always equal to the number of poles. For a wave winding, the number of paths is always equal to two. Therefore, for a four-pole, lap-wound machine a 4. 2.

Thus, the calibration of the high-impedance voltmeter scale is such that each 1-V division is equivalent to a speed of 25.2 rads/s. With each revolution being equal to 2  rad, the calibration also is equivalent to a speed of 25.2/(2 ) or 4 r/s for each 1-V division, or (4 r/s)(60 s/min) 240 r/min for each 1-V division. Related Calculations. The small dc generator, mechanically coupled to a motor, gives an output voltage that is directly proportional in magnitude to the speed of rotation. Not only may that voltage be read on a voltmeter-scale calibrated in units of speed but also it may be applied to a control circuit of the larger motor in such a way as to make desired corrections in speed. This type of tachometer affords a simple means for regulating the speed of a motor. SEPARATELY EXCITED DC GENERATOR’S RATED CONDITIONS FROM NO-LOAD SATURATION CURVE A separately excited dc generator has a no-load saturation curve as shown in Fig. 3.1 and an equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2. Its nameplate data are as follows: 5 kW, 125 V, 1150 r/min, and armature circuit resistance Ra 0.40 . Assume that the generator is driven at 1200 r/min and that the field current is adjusted by field rheostat to equal 2.0 A. If the load is the nameplate rating, find the terminal voltage, Vt . Armature reaction and brush losses may be neglected. Calculation Procedure 1. Calculate the Armature Induced Voltage, ea The no-load saturation curve is obtained at rated speed of 1150 r/min. In this case, however, the driven speed is 1200 r/min. For a given field flux (field current), the induced 3.2 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS voltage is proportional to speed. Thus, if If is 2.0 A, the induced voltage at 1150 r/min from the no-load saturation curve is equal to 250 V. The induced voltage at the higher speed of 1200 r/min is ea (1200/1150)(250 V) 260.9 V. 2. Calculate the Rated Load Current, IL The rated load current is obtained from the equation: IL nameplate kilowatt rating/nameplate kilovolt rating 5 kW/0.125 kV 40 A. Note that the speed does not enter into this calculation; the current, voltage, and power ratings are limited by (or determined by) the thermal limitations (size of copper, insulation, heat dissipation, etc.). DC MOTORS AND GENERATORS 3.3 FIGURE 3.1 No-load saturation curve for a separately excited dc generator, at 1150 r/min. FIGURE 3.2 Equivalent circuit of a separately excited dc generator. 3. Calculate the Terminal Voltage, Vt The terminal voltage is determined from Kirchhoff’s voltage law; or simply Vt ea   ILRa 260.9 V   (40 A)(0.4 ) 244.9 V. Related Calculations. This same procedure is used for calculating the terminal voltage for any variation in speed. If there were a series field or if there were a shunt field connected across the armature, essentially the same procedure is followed, with proper allowance for the additional circuitry and the variation in the total field flux, as in the next three problems. TERMINAL CONDITIONS CALCULATED FOR DC COMPOUND GENERATOR A compound dc generator is connected long-shunt. The data for the machine are as follows: 150 kW, 240 V, 625 A, series-field resistance Rs 0.0045 , armature-circuit resistance Ra 0.023 , shunt-field turns per pole 1100, and series-field turns per pole 5. Calculate the terminal voltage at rated load current when the shunt-field current is 5.0 A and the speed is 950 r/min. The no-load saturation curve of this machine at 1100 r/min is shown in Fig. 3.3. Calculation Procedure 1. Draw the Equivalent Circuit Diagram The equivalent circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 3.3. 2. Calculate the Current in the Series Field, Is With reference to Fig. 3.3, the current in the series field is Is Ia IL If 625 A 5.0 A 630 A. 3. Convert Series-Field Current to Equivalent Shunt-Field Current So that the no-load saturation curve (Fig. 3.4) may be used, the series-field current is converted to equivalent shunt-field current; then, a total field flux is determined from the shunt-field current plus the equivalent shunt-field current of the series field. The equivalent shunt-field current of the series field is calculated from the relation: actual ampereturns of series field/actual turns of shunt field (630 A)(5 turns)/1100 turns 2.86 A. The total flux in terms of field currents shunt-field current equivalent shunt-field current of series field 5.0 A 2.86 A 7.86 A. 3.4 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 3.3 Equivalent circuit for a long-shunt compound dc generator. 4. Calculate Armature Induced Voltage, ea With reference to the no-load saturation curve of Fig. 3.4, enter the graph at field current of 7.86 A. The no-load induced voltage ea 280 V at 1100 r/min. When the machine is driven at 950 r/min, the induced voltage ea (280 V)(950/1100) 242 V. 5. Calculate the Terminal Voltage, Vt The terminal voltage is calculated from Kirchhoff’s voltage law: Vt ea   Ia(Ra Rs) 242 V   (630 A)(0.023 0.0045 ) 224.7 V. Related Calculations. In the long-shunt connection the series field is connected on the armature side of the shunt field; in the short-shunt connection the series field is connected on the terminal side of the shunt field. In the latter case, the series-field current is equal to IL rather than Ia; Kirchhoff’s voltage equation still is applicable. There is little difference between long-shunt and short-shunt compounding. In both cases, it is necessary to determine the net flux per pole; the series-field flux may be additive or subtractive. In this problem, it was assumed to be additive. ADDED SERIES FIELD CALCULATED TO PRODUCE FLAT COMPOUNDING IN DC GENERATOR A given dc generator is to be flat compounded. Its data are: 150 kW, 240 V, 625 A, 1100 r/min, armature-circuit resistance Ra 0.023 , shunt-field turns per pole 1100, series-field turns per pole 5, and series-field resistance Rs 0.0045 . It is driven at a constant speed of 1100 r/min, for which the no-load saturation curve is given in Fig. 3.4. DC MOTORS AND GENERATORS 3.5 FIGURE 3.4 No-load saturation curve for a 240-V, 1100-r/min dc generator. Determine the shunt-field circuit resistance for rated conditions (assuming long-shunt connections) and calculate the armature current to be diverted from the series field, for flat compounding at 250 V, and the resistance value of the diverter. Calculation Procedure 1. Calculate the Value of the Shunt-Field Circuit Resistance From the no-load saturation curve (Fig. 3.4), the 250-V point indicates a shunt-field current If of 5.6 A. A field-resistance line is drawn on the no-load saturation curve (a straight line from the origin to point 250 V, 5.6 A); this represents a shunt-field circuit resistance of (250 V)/(5.6 A) 44.6 . That is, for the no-load voltage to be 250 V, the shunt-field resistance must be 44.6 . 2. Calculate the Armature Values at Rated Conditions For an armature current of 625 A, IaRa (625 A)(0.023 ) 14.4 V. The armature current Ia If IL 5.6 A 625 A 630.6 A. The induced armature voltage ea Vt Ia(Ra Rs) 250 V (630.6 A)(0.023 0.0045 ) 267.3 V. 3. Calculate Needed Contribution of Series Field at Rated Conditions At rated conditions, the current through the series field is 630.6 A (the same as Ia); refer to the long-shunt equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 3.3. For the induced voltage of 267.3 V (again referring to the no-load saturation curve), the indicated excitation is 6.6 A. Thus, the contribution from the series field 6.6. A   5.6 A 1.0 A (in equivalent shunt-field amperes). The actual series-field current needed to produce the 1.0 A of equivalent shunt-field current is proportional to the number of turns in the respective fields (1.0 A)(1100/5) 220 A. 4. Calculate Diverter Resistance Because the actual current through the series field would be 630.6 A and 220 A is sufficient to produce flat compounding (Vt 250 V at no load and at full load), 630.6 A   220 A 410.6 A must be diverted through a resistor shunted across the series field. The value of that resistor voltage across the series field/current to be diverted (220 A 0.0045 )/410.6 A 0.0024 . Related Calculations. In this problem, armature reaction was ignored because of lack of data. A better calculation would require saturation curves not only for no-load but also for rated full-load current. That full-load current curve would droop below the no-load curve in the region above the knee of the curve (above 250 V in this example). With these data taken into account, the needed series-field contribution to the magnetic field would be greater than what was calculated, and the current to be diverted would be less. Effectively, armature reaction causes a weakening of the magnetic field, in addition to distortion of that field. The actual calculations made in this problem would result in slight undercompounding, rather than flat compounding. CALCULATION OF INTERPOLE WINDINGS FOR A DC GENERATOR A dc lap-wound generator has the following data: 500 kW, 600 V, 4 poles, 4 interpoles, 464 armature conductors. The magnetomotive force (mmf) of the interpoles is 20 percent greater than that of the armature. Determine the number of turns on the interpoles. 3.6 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS Calculation Procedure 1. Calculate the Number of Armature Turns per Pole If there are 464 armature conductors, then the number of turns is one-half of that amount; every two conductors constitute one turn. The machine has 4 poles; thus, armature turns per pole (armature conductors/2)/number of poles (464/2)/4 58. 2. Calculate the Current per Armature Path For a lap winding, the number of paths (in parallel) is always equal to the number of poles; in this problem, it is 4. The armature current per path Ia /4. This represents the current in each armature conductor or in each turn. 3. Calculate the Number of Turns on the Interpoles The interpoles (also known as commutating poles) are for the purpose of providing mmf along the quadrature axis to reverse the flux in that space caused by the crossmagnetizing effect of armature reaction (see Fig. 3.5). They have a small number of turns of large cross section because the interpoles, being in series with the armature, carry armature current. The mmf of the armature per pole is: armature turns per pole armature current in each conductor 58(Ia /4) 14.5Ia ampere-turns. If the interpoles have an mmf 20 percent greater, then each one is (1.20)(14.5)Ia 17.4Ia ampere-turns. The calculated number of turns on each interpole 17.4; in actuality, use 17 turns. Related Calculations. The function of interpoles is to improve commutation, that is, to eliminate sparking of the brushes as they slide over the commutator bars. The mmf of the interpoles usually is between 20 to 40 percent greater than the armature DC MOTORS AND GENERATORS 3.7 FIGURE 3.5 Representation of the effect of interpoles on flux density. mmf, when the number of interpoles is equal to the number of main poles. If one-half of the number of interpoles is used, the mmf design is usually 40 to 60 percent greater than the armature mmf. These calculations are always on a per-pole basis. Because interpoles operate on armature current, their mmf is proportional to the effects of armature reaction. DESIGN OF COMPENSATING WINDING FOR DC MACHINE A lap-wound dc machine has the following data: four poles, ratio of pole face to pole span 0.75, total number of armature slots 33, number of conductors per slot 12. Design a compensating winding for each pole face (i.e., find the number of conductors to be placed in each pole face and the number of slots on that face). See Fig. 3.6. Calculation Procedure 1. Calculate Armature mmf in One Pole Span The number of armature turns in a pole span is (total number of armature conductors/2)/number of poles [(12 conductors per slot)(33 slots)/2]/4 poles 49.5 armature turns. The current in each conductor is the current in each parallel path. For a lap-wound machine, the number of parallel paths is the same as the number of poles; in this problem, it is 4. The armature mmf in a pole span (armature turns in a pole span) (armature current per path) (49.5)(Ia /4) 12.4 Ia ampere-turns. 3.8 HANDBOOK OF ELECTRIC POWER CALCULATIONS FIGURE 3.6 Pole having compensating winding in face. 2. Calculate the Armature Ampere-Turns per Pole Face The ratio of the pole face to pole span is given as 0.75. Therefore, the armature (mmf) ampere-turns per pole face (0.75) (12.4 Ia) 9.3 ampere-turns. 3. Calculate the Number of Conductors in the Compensating Winding The purpose of the compensating winding is to neutralize the armature mmf that distorts the flux density distribution. Under sudden changes in loading, there would be a flashover tendency across adjacent commutator bars; the compensating-winding effect overcomes this and is proportional to the armature current because it is connected in the armature circuit. Therefore, to design the compensating winding, it is necessary to have it produce essentially the same number of ampere-turns as the armature circuit under each pole face. In this problem, each pole face must produce 9.3 ampere-turns; this requires that each pole face have (2)(9.3 turns) 18.6 conductors (say 18 or 19 conductors). 4. Calculate the Number of Slots in the Pole Face The slots in the pole face should not have the same spacing as on the armature; otherwise, reluctance torques would occur as the opposite slots and teeth went in and out of alignment. The number of slots on the armature opposite a pole face is (33 slots)(0.75 ratio)/4 poles 6.2 slots. For a different number of slots, 5 could be selected and 4 conductors could be placed in each slot (the total being 20 conductors). Another solution might be 8 slots with 2 conductors in each slot (the total being 16 conductors). Related Calculations. In many cases, machines will have both interpoles (see previous problem) and compensating windings. The winding connections of the machine are shown in Fig. 3.7. STATOR AND ARMATURE RESISTANCE CALCULATIONS IN DC SELF-EXCITED GENERATOR A self-excited dc generator has the following data: 10 kW, 240 V. Under rated conditions, the voltage drop in the armature circuit is determined to be 6.1 percent of the terminal voltage. Also, the shunt-field current is determined to be 4.8 percent of the rated-load current. Calculate the armature circuit resistance and the shunt-field circuit resistance.
